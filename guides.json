The paper proposes a comprehensive set of ideal constructs and metrics that could be measured for benchmarking open data: from the existence of laws and licensing as a measure of context, to access to education as a measure of impact.</p>\n<p>Recognising that not all of these suggestions are feasible, the paper goes on to make practical recommendations for researchers, developers and policy-makers about how to put automated assessment of open data into practice:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Introduce automated assessments of open data quality, e.g. on timeliness, where data and metadata are available.</li>\n<li>Integrate the automated use of global performance indicators, e.g. internet freedoms, to understand open data’s context and environment.</li>\n<li>When planning open data projects, consider how the design may allow automated assessments from the outset.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Improving automatic assessment methods for open data may increase its quality and reach, and therefore help to enhance its social, environmental and economic value around the world. For example, putting an emphasis on metadata may ensure that data publishers spend enough time on preparing the data before their release. This paper will help organisations apply benchmarking methods at larger scale, with lower cost and higher frequency.</p>\n<p><em>This paper is part of a series produced by the Open Data Institute, as part of t<a href=\"http://theodi.org/odp4d\">he Partnership for Open Data (POD)</a>, funded by the World Bank.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<iframe style=\"max-width:100%;\" class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/253062811/content?start_page=1&view_mode=slideshow&access_key=key-ZbCpVgA0HFVYWmYRQzii&show_recommendations=false\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7080062794348508\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_71948\" width=\"600px\" height=\"880px\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"Download and read the report here","url":"https://www.scribd.com/document_downloads/253062811?extension=pdf&from=embed&source=embed"},{"title":"Find out more about the Partnership for Open Data","url":"http://theodi.org/odp4d"}],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/data-identifiers-white-paper.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/guides/data-identifiers-white-paper","slug":"data-identifiers-white-paper","title":"White paper: Enhancing open data with identifiers","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-05-16T14:17:55+00:00","created_at":"2014-10-30T10:24:07+00:00","tag_ids":["guide","whitepaper","identifiers","thompson-reuters"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/guide.json","web_url":null,"title":"Guide","details":{"description":"Guide","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=guide","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/guide","slug":"guide"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/whitepaper.json","web_url":null,"title":"Whitepaper","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=whitepaper","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/whitepaper","slug":"whitepaper"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/identifiers.json","web_url":null,"title":"Identifiers","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=identifiers","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/identifiers","slug":"identifiers"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/thompson-reuters.json","web_url":null,"title":"Thompson Reuters","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=thompson-reuters","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/thompson-reuters","slug":"thompson-reuters"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>The Open Data Institute and Thomson Reuters have published a new white paper, explaining how to use identifiers to create extra value in open data.</p>","excerpt":"<iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/110875561?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"390\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p><small><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/110875561\">Dave Weller - Linked data and the future of the Web</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/theodiuk\">Open Data Institute</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</small></p>\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"White paper: Enhancing open data with identifiers","url":"","content":"<iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/110875561?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"390\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><small><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/110875561\">Dave Weller - Linked data and the future of the Web</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/theodiuk\">Open Data Institute</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</small></p>\n<p><em>The Open Data Institute and Thomson Reuters have published a new white paper, explaining how to use identifiers to create extra value in open data.</em></p>\n<p>Identifiers are at the heart of how data becomes linked. It’s a subject that is fundamentally important to the open data community, and to the evolution of the web itself. However, identifiers are also in relatively early stages of adoption, and not many are aware of what they are.\nw\nPut simply, identifiers are labels used to refer to an object being discussed or exchanged, such as products, companies or people. The foundation of the web is formed by connections that hold pieces of information together. Identifiers are the anchors that facilitate those links.</p>\n<p>This white paper, <strong>'Creating value with identifiers in an open data world'</strong> is a joint effort between <a href=\"http://thomsonreuters.com/site/data-identifiers/\" title=\"Thomson Reuters\">Thomson Reuters</a> and the Open Data Institute. It is written as a guide to identifier schemes: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>why identity can be difficult to manage; </li>\n<li>why it is important for open data; </li>\n<li>what challenges there are today and recommendations for the community to address these in the future. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Illustrative examples of identifier schemes are used to explain these points.</p>\n<p>The recommendations are based on specific issues found to occur across different datasets, and should be relevant for anyone using, publishing or handling open data, closed data and/or their own proprietary data sets.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you a data consumer?</strong>\nLearn how identifiers can help you create value from discovering and connecting to other sources of data that add relevant context.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you a data publisher?</strong> \nLearn how understanding and engaging with identifier schemes can reduce your costs, and help you manage complexity.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you an identifier publisher?</strong>\nLearn how open licensing can grow the open data commons and bring you extra value by increasing the use of your identifier scheme.</p>\n<p>The design and use of successful identifier schemes requires a mix of social, data and technical engineering. We hope that this white paper will act as a starting point for discussion about how identifiers can and will create value by empowering linked data.</p>\n<p>Read the blog post on <a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/guest-post-linked-data-and-the-future-of-the-web\" title=\"Linked data and the future of the web\">Linked data and the future of the web</a>, from Chief Enterprise Architect for Thomson Reuters, Dave Weller.</p>\n<p>When citing this white paper, please use the following text: <em>Open Data Institute and Thomson Reuters, 2014, Creating Value with Identifiers in an Open Data World, retrieved from <a href=\"http://thomsonreuters.com/site/data-identifiers/\" title=\"thomsonreuters.com/site/data-identifiers/\">thomsonreuters.com/site/data-identifiers/</a></em></p>\n<hr />\n<iframe style=\"float:left; max-width:100%;\" width=\"800px\" height=\"1000px\" class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/245084418/content?start_page=1&view_mode=slideshow&access_key=key-RPsY61aSf8h5ktYYhLlM&show_recommendations=false\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7080062794348508\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_67858\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[{"name":"I Can Make","slug":"i-can-make","url_helper":"http://theodi.org/start-ups/i-can-make"}],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/guest-post-linked-data-and-the-future-of-the-web.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/guest-post-linked-data-and-the-future-of-the-web","slug":"guest-post-linked-data-and-the-future-of-the-web","title":"Guest post: Linked data and the future of the web","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:57:48+00:00","created_at":"2014-10-30T11:56:32+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","identifiers","thompson-reuters","linked-data"]}],"organizations":[{"name":"I Can Make","slug":"i-can-make","url_helper":"http://theodi.org/start-ups/i-can-make"}],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/engaging-reusers.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/guides/engaging-reusers","slug":"engaging-reusers","title":"Engaging with reusers","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:51:32+00:00","created_at":"2013-06-17T21:04:41+00:00","tag_ids":["guide"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/guide.json","web_url":null,"title":"Guide","details":{"description":"Guide","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=guide","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/guide","slug":"guide"}}],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"excerpt":"If you are publishing open data, you are usually doing so because you want people to reuse it.

This guide discusses ways in which you can help to maximise that reuse by engaging with those who you want to reuse it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beforepublication\">Before Publication</h2>\n<p>Publishing open data requires time and effort, so as you invest those resources in opening up data, you should have a clear idea about <a href=\"/guide/how-make-business-case-open-data\">why you are publishing it</a>, and about the different groups who may reuse your data. This will help you to identify which of those groups will reuse data in ways that support your objectives, so you can target your engagement activities.</p>\n<p>The open data you publish may be reused within existing applications and services. So, before publishing the data, try to identify existing applications and services that could make use of your data, and engage with their developers.</p>\n<p>Try also to identify the researchers, community groups, or interested individuals who might get value from your data. And don't forget the people within your own organisation who might benefit from easier access to your data.</p>\n<p>In this preparatory stage, you should be asking:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How could the reusers make use of the data?</li>\n<li>What formats and mechanisms are easiest for the different reusers to work with?</li>\n<li>What guarantees do the reusers need to start working with the data?</li>\n<li>Are there any other barriers, such as poor data quality, that could prevent reuse?</li>\n<li>What support will different reusers need to understand and make use of the data?</li>\n<li>What capacity do you have to handle enquiries generated by reusers of the data?</li>\n<li>What opportunities are there for collaborating with reusers of your data?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Having a conversation with existing and potential reusers of your data will help you to identify the best ways of publishing your data. However, you should make sure that the way you publish data does not exclude potential new reusers. For example, even if an existing reuser would like you to publish in a particular proprietary format, you should still aim to publish in an open standard format to meet the needs of future reusers.</p>\n<p>Part of this engagement might include events that bring together potential reusers with those who understand the context, content and utility of the data. At this stage, these events should be targeted at addressing the questions above rather than the creation of applications or services.</p>\n<p>Getting data curators and data reusers to talk to each other regularly can support ongoing improvements of data, help those in your organisation who are supporting access to the data to get the appreciation they deserve, and maximise the value gained from opening up your data both for your organisation and more widely.</p>\n<h2 id=\"documentation\">Documentation</h2>\n<p>The reusers of open data need to understand the data you are publishing in order to work with it. To minimise both the demands on your time and the barriers for reuse, you need good documentation that allows reusers to make sense of your data without direct support. There are a number of important forms of documentation:</p>\n<h3 id=\"metadata\">Metadata</h3>\n<p>Metadata is information about the data that you are publishing. This should describe enough of the context of the publication to help reusers to understand what it does and doesn't contain, how to interpret it correctly, and whether it's appropriate for them to trust it.</p>\n<p>The documentation that you provide should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>descriptive metadata</strong> such as a title, description, keywords or tags and so on, to help reusers understand what the data contains</li>\n<li><strong>legal information</strong> including the copyright statement and indications of the licence(s) under which the data is being made available, including required attribution and any other terms or conditions of use (which should be minimal to encourage reuse)</li>\n<li><strong>coverage information</strong> including its geographical coverage (which areas of the world it relates to), temporal coverage (which time frames the data relates to) and its completeness (which items are included or excluded from the data)</li>\n<li><strong>timeliness information</strong> including information about when the data was published, when it was last modified, how frequently updates will appear and the lag between the collection of the data and its publication</li>\n<li><strong>reliability information</strong> including some information about your intention to continue providing the data over time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If there are existing manuals or other detailed documents that explain how the data was collected, and that offer guidance for using it, then you should consider publishing these.</p>\n<p>Equipped with this information, reusers should be able to tell whether the data is interesting and useful for them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"technicaldocumentation\">Technical Documentation</h3>\n<p>Data usually contains a specific set of fields or columns and codes, which reusers need to understand to work effectively with the data. If it's served through an API or service, reusers will also need to understand how the API works.</p>\n<p>The technical documentation that you provide should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>format documentation</strong> about the data formats that you are providing, possibly including schemas for any vocabularies that you use</li>\n<li><strong>code lists</strong> that provide more details about each of the codes that are used within your data; one way to provide this information is to have a URL that provides documentation about each code and to link to that URL within the data</li>\n<li><strong>service documentation</strong> that describes the way any API that you provide works; this might include links to machine-readable service descriptions if applicable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Equipped with this information, reusers should be able to understand the data that you're publishing and how to create applications that use it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"support\">Support</h2>\n<p>Engagement with reusers is a two-way street, and you should provide methods for reusers to get back in touch with you. You should also try to enable reusers to help each other.</p>\n<p>The support you provide should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a <strong>data contact</strong> for questions reusers might have about the data or issues that they're having using it, including bugs that arise in your provision</li>\n<li>a <strong>forum</strong> where you recommend reusers pose questions of other reusers, so that they can help each other; this doesn't have to be a site that you manage: one option is to point reusers to <a href=\"http://getthedata.org/\">Get the Data</a> as the forum of choice</li>\n<li>a contact route for <strong>error reports</strong> to enable reusers to provide corrections for problems they spot within the data; the information you provide should set expectations about how those reports will be dealt with, and you should indicate how existing reusers are informed of these corrections</li>\n<li>if your data contains or is derived from personal information, you should have a contact point for any <strong>confidentiality concerns</strong> that reusers have</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"services\">Services</h2>\n<p>If your data is important and complex, it will help reusers if you can provide tools, such as plugins, visualisations, software libraries and services, that enable reusers to build on others' work with the data. You might find that these tools get built by third parties.</p>\n<p>You should have a page that lists these tools, and indicate how additional tools created by third parties can be added to the list within that page.</p>\n<h2 id=\"activeoutreach\">Active Outreach</h2>\n<p>Understanding and tracking reuse of your data can help you to plan improvements and to make the case for further data releases. You should consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>maintaining an active presence on <strong>social media</strong></li>\n<li>using <strong>search engine alerts</strong> to find out when your data is mentioned</li>\n<li><strong>blogging</strong> to showcase good examples of use of your data</li>\n<li>arranging <strong>hackdays or competitions</strong> to encourage the use of your data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whilst not worthwhile for all datasets, in some cases explicit community building, engagement and outreach work can help to maximise the value that your data brings to your organisation and to others.</p>\n<h2 id=\"furtherreading\">Further Reading</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.opendataimpacts.net/engagement/\">Open Data Engagement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.digitalengagement.info/\">Digital Engagement</a></li>\n</ul>","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/faq.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/guides/faq","slug":"faq","title":"FAQs - About the ODI","format":"article","updated_at":"2017-04-18T15:39:59+00:00","created_at":"2012-07-12T09:55:10+00:00","tag_ids":["guide","open-data","faqs","open-data-institute"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/guide.json","web_url":null,"title":"Guide","details":{"description":"Guide","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=guide","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/guide","slug":"guide"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/open-data.json","web_url":null,"title":"open data","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=open-data","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/open-data","slug":"open-data"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/faqs.json","web_url":null,"title":"faqs","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=faqs","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/faqs","slug":"faqs"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/open-data-institute.json","web_url":null,"title":"open data institute","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=open-data-institute","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/open-data-institute","slug":"open-data-institute"}}],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"What is open data?\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"","url":"","content":"<h3 id=\"whatisopendata\">What is open data?</h3>\n<p>Open data is data that anyone can access, use and share. <a href=\"http://theodi.org/what-is-open-data\" title=\"Read our full, simple explanation here\">Read our full, simple explanation here</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whoistheopendatainstituteandwhatisitspurpose\">Who is the Open Data Institute and what is its purpose?</h3>\n<p>The Open Data Institute helps governments and businesses around the world to get data to people who need it.

Here we guide you through the steps needed to maximise the benefits of opening data by asking four questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What are your organisation's goals?</li>\n<li>How is data used now, and how could it be used?</li>\n<li>How can you get value for your business?</li>\n<li>How do the business models compare?</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"whatareyourorganisationsgoals\">What are your organisation's goals?</h3>\n<p>The first step in working on a business case for open data is to identify your organisation's goals and the way in which they are satisfied. Open data should be used as a tool to help your organisation achieve these goals. These goals might include wider social, environmental and economic benefits as well as direct benefits to your organisation.</p>\n<p>You should also consider how your organisation will work in the future, when much data is shared as open data. What role will your organisation play in that environment? Will there be new opportunities that you can take advantage of?</p>\n<h3 id=\"howisdatausednowandhowcoulditbeused\">How is data used now, and how could it be used?</h3>\n<p>The second step is to look at the way data is used in areas where sharing data more easily would help your organisation meet its goals. Identify:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the groups with whom you are sharing data</li>\n<li>data that is currently being shared between those agents</li>\n<li>problems with the currently shared data that makes it less useful than it could be</li>\n<li>other data that, if available, would help address your organisational goals</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"groups\">Groups</h3>\n<p>Potential groups involved in your data flows might be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>other parts of your own organisation</li>\n<li>partners</li>\n<li>regulators</li>\n<li>suppliers</li>\n<li>customers</li>\n<li>competitors</li>\n<li>journalists</li>\n<li>government</li>\n<li>researchers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Look at your existing data sharing arrangements and the numbers of requests for data that you receive to identify places where there is a demand for open data. Ask those groups whose work complements yours how they currently use data and what other data would enable them to work more effectively.</p>\n<h3 id=\"data\">Data</h3>\n<p>Organisations often underestimate the information they hold and the potential of that data.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The main type of data that organisations work with is <strong>administrative data</strong>. These are the records that are made as part of an organisation carrying out its day-to-day business. Examples are point-of-sale receipts, website access logs, or railway maintenance plans.</li>\n<li>Organisations often own <strong>reference data</strong> that is simply used to provide information that rarely changes about things, which helps to understand other data. Reference data commonly includes <strong>identifiers</strong> for these things. Common reference data is often shared between and used by many organisations. Examples are product information, charity registrations, or taxi licences.</li>\n<li>To make sense of the low-level information within administrative datasets, they usually have to be analysed and summarised. This <strong>aggregate data</strong> can show trends over time or highlight differences in different geographical areas or for different products or services. An example would be total sales of each product over time across supermarkets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sharing raw administrative data can be hard because it often contains <strong>personal data</strong> and therefore can't usually be released under data protection legislation. Having unique access to this data may also provide you with a competitive advantage. There are usually fewer barriers to providing reference and aggregate data as open data.</p>\n<p>It is easiest to share data that your organisation has gathered and maintains itself, because then you know that your organisation owns that data. If some of the data originates from another organisation, your ability to share that data will be determined by the licence through which it was made available to you. Open data can be shared (and if it was made available under a share-alike licence, you must use the same open licence for the data you have created). Closed data usually cannot be shared onwards.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howcanyougetvalueforyourbusiness\">How can you get value for your business?</h3>\n<p>When you look at what data is flowing between your organisation and other groups, there will be some that your organisation can affect, by sharing more or better quality data with others or by ensuring that you receive more or better quality data from someone else.</p>\n<p>Publishing open data can be supported through three general business models, described in detail below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>freemium</strong>: you provide an \"added value\" data product or service, for which you charge</li>\n<li><strong>cross subsidy</strong>: you reach more customers, or provide enhanced services to existing customers, through wider sharing and use of your data</li>\n<li><strong>network effects</strong>: by collaborating with other organisations, you reduce your costs in maintaining data which you use in your work or extend the possible audience for your products and services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These different ways of supporting open data can be used together for a single dataset, or different models can be used for different datasets. There isn't one right model to use. For example, an organisation might provide open access to some data to enable a larger community to improve its quality, exploiting network effects, and because it drives business towards the products and services offered by the organisation that owns it, which is a cross-subsidy-based business model.</p>\n<h3 id=\"freemium\">Freemium</h3>\n<p>Freemium business models are used for a variety of web applications. With a freemium business model, the free product or service is subsidised through a paid-for product or service that offers some kind of added value on top of what's made available as open data. The free product acts as marketing, establishing the provider in the marketplace and increasing the take-up of the paid-for product.</p>\n<p>One way of using a freemium model is to release your open data using a <strong>share-alike licence</strong>. This ensures that organisations who do things with your data have to either openly share their results (which means you can benefit from what they do) or have to negotiate with you to be able to use the data under a different (potentially charged) licence.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://opencorporates.com/\">OpenCorporates</a> uses this business model, <a href=\"http://opencorporates.com/info/licence#database\">licensing their database with a share-alike licence</a> while offering paid-for licences for companies who do not want to share their data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another approach to a freemium model is to offer a paid-for product that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>incorporates additional data, perhaps from third-party sources</li>\n<li>is provided in a different format from the open data</li>\n<li>is more up-to-date, complete or detailed than the open data</li>\n<li>is the result of an analysis or model based on the released open data</li>\n<li>is a dump of data that can otherwise be accessed through an API</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alternatively, you could offer a paid-for service based on the open data you are publishing that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>provides an API over open data that can otherwise be accessed as a dump</li>\n<li>provides availability guarantees through a Service-Level Agreement</li>\n<li>removes rate limits</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://placr.co.uk/\">Placr</a> uses this as one of its business models by having a <a href=\"https://developer.transportapi.com/plans\">rate-limit on their Transport API</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"crosssubsidy\">Cross subsidy</h3>\n<p>Cross-subsidising business models fund the release of open data through other benefits to your organisation. Sharing open data can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>help or prompt customers to use the products and services that you offer, which can help you gain and retain customers</li>\n<li>enable information to flow more efficiently within your organisation and between you and your partners, which can save time and resources within your organisation</li>\n<li>increase brand awareness and enhance your reputation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Here are some examples:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>advertise</strong>: datasets that are widely used can be effective advertising for your organisation, either due to attribution or by driving people to you using the identifiers in the data</li>\n<li><strong>provide support services</strong>: as you are the people who know your data best, you could offer consultancy or other support services that help other people take advantage of the open data you provide</li>\n<li><strong>charge for changes</strong>: if your dataset holds information from other organisations or individuals, and they benefit from having that information be up to date, you can charge them for changes they make to the dataset</li>\n<li><strong>be accountable</strong>: openly sharing data about your organisation shows that you value transparency and accountability for your business practice, which can enhance your reputation</li>\n<li><strong>reduce your data sharing overhead</strong>: if you have to regularly send the same information to multiple recipients, publishing that data can help them access it when they need it and reduce your internal administration burden</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.geolytix.co.uk/\">Geolytix</a> provides an <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.geolytix.co.uk%2Fdata-and-software%2Fcensus&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEZFISlK-xpF3s--kB5FZ0muuGE2g\">open census pack</a> to advertise the other products and services that it offers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Making data available as open data lowers the barriers for third-party developers to reuse that data. Third-party developers can then create tools that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>extend your audience</strong>: if your organisation has a goal of raising awareness of a particular issue, opening up data is one way to achieve this, particularly as third-party developers might provide access to the information through different channels (such as mobile apps)</li>\n<li><strong>smooth demand curves</strong>: if you provide a service, sharing information about how busy you are at different times of day can enable third-party developers to create tools that help customers contact you when you are less busy, smoothing out demand for the service</li>\n<li><strong>become more findable</strong>: if you have branches from which you provide a service, sharing information about their location, opening times, and what they offer can enable third-party developers to incorporate this information into maps, helping customers to find you</li>\n<li><strong>out-source your R&D</strong>: opening up data can be a cost-effective mechanism for out-sourcing research and development of new products and services, which you can then take advantage of or purchase</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mbta.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHslBeD9eKB0hWQ5my6qSPEuGrDEg\">Massachusetts</a> <a href=\"http://www.mbta.com/\"> Bay Transportation Authority</a> publishes open data about transport in the area which has been used to create <a href=\"http://www.mbta.com/rider_tools/apps/\">huge numbers of apps</a> that help people navigate effectively around the city.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"networkeffects\">Network effects</h3>\n<p>The business models that have the most potential for a big return on investment, for all concerned, are those that take advantage of network effects around data sharing.</p>\n<p>There are two kinds of network effects that you should try to take advantage of in an open data business model:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Groups of organisations can <strong>collaboratively maintain</strong> open datasets, benefiting from each others' contributions and improving the set of data that each organisation can use. This can work particularly well to improve the quality of datasets that aren't complete or completely accurate. Contributions might alternatively include sponsorship or donations that help to support the dataset's maintenance.</li>\n<li>Releasing open data can help to <strong>grow the market</strong> for particular products and services, particularly when particular tools or services are well-placed to help organisations and individuals to take advantage of that data.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/\">OpenStreetMap</a> is created and maintained by numerous contributors, with its infrastructure supported through donations from <a href=\"http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Partners\">key partners</a>.</p>\n  <p><a href=\"http://legislation.gov.uk/\">Legislation.gov.uk</a> is made available as open data and <a href=\"http://blog.okfn.org/2012/10/04/worlds-first-real-commercial-open-data-curation-project/\">maintained through collaboration</a> across the public and private sector.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"howdothebusinessmodelscompare\">How do the business models compare?</h3>\n<p>You might identify several potential business models that involve publishing open data. To make a business case, you need to compare these with each other, with the impact of doing nothing, and (sometimes) with a business model based on selling the data.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Morten Lind's presentation on <a href=\"http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/events/conferences/inspire_2011/presentations/216.pdf\">Value of Information: Assessing Social and Economic Benefits in the Context of SDI and PSI</a> shows this kind of analyses in the context of a public sector organisation releasing various geographic datasets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Organisations can overestimate the return on investment of selling the data they own (including making it available through a freemium business model) if they underestimate the costs that can be involved, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>legal costs of creating and enforcing restrictive licences</li>\n<li>development costs of restricting access and use of data</li>\n<li>administrative costs of issuing licences</li>\n<li>sales and marketing costs to promote the data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are also strategic risks if you build a business based on charging for data. As we have seen in the music, news and software industries, people are becoming less prepared to pay for digital products that can easily be copied and shared with others. Competitors or communities might also be able to undermine your data business by releasing their data as open data.</p>\n<p>You might decide to trial using open data to discover what impact it has. If you do this, you should collect evidence during the trial to measure how much the open data is used and how this usage relates to value for your organisation. Bear in mind third parties might not invest in using data from your organisation unless some guarantees are given about its continuing availability and consistency over time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"furtherinformation\">Further information</h3>\n<p>Further discussion of business models for open data can be found at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IWP_WCzkEc\">Open data: Where's the Benefit?</a> talk by Jeni Tennison</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/hverwayen/business-model-innovation-open-data\">Business model innovation open data</a> slides by Harry Verwayen</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2012/06/pmod/pmod2012_submission_16.pdf\">Business models for PSI re-use: a multidimensional framework</a> paper by Enrico Ferro &amp; Michele Osella</li>\n</ul>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/how-to-plan-and-budget-an-open-data-initiative.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/guides/how-to-plan-and-budget-an-open-data-initiative","slug":"how-to-plan-and-budget-an-open-data-initiative","title":"How to plan and budget an open data initiative","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:02:46+00:00","created_at":"2015-07-28T12:16:17+00:00","tag_ids":["guide","open-data-initiative","open-government","open-data","budgeting","strategy"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/guide.json","web_url":null,"title":"Guide","details":{"description":"Guide","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=guide","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/guide","slug":"guide"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/open-data-initiative.json","web_url":null,"title":"open data initiative","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=open-data-initiative","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/open-data-initiative","slug":"open-data-initiative"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/open-government.json","web_url":null,"title":"open government","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=open-government","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/open-government","slug":"open-government"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/open-data.json","web_url":null,"title":"open data","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=open-data","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/open-data","slug":"open-data"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/budgeting.json","web_url":null,"title":"budgeting","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=budgeting","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/budgeting","slug":"budgeting"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/strategy.json","web_url":null,"title":"strategy","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=strategy","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/strategy","slug":"strategy"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>This guide draws together the conclusions and further input from other experienced government leaders in open data.

While some of the participating countries have made great strides in implementing open data, others are in the early stages of their open data initiative. </p>\n<p>A key question from these leaders was how much their government should expect to spend on an open data initiative – this information would determine the size of the budget they should request.</p>\n<p>In an extended discussion between the group and assembled international experts an initial list of cost headings was developed, and this was extended and refined by further collaborative efforts facilitated by the Open Data Institute (ODI).</p>\n<p>This guide draws together the conclusions and further input from other experienced government leaders in open data. It was developed to support open data leaders in government, and those considering implementing an open data initiative.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Disclaimer</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>This guidance note does not seek to give specific figures, and does not do so. Actual costs will depend both on the quantity of the various resources required to successfully implement an open data initiative and on the salary and other rates for the required inputs. Both can vary widely.</em></p>\n<p><em>Actual budgetary requirements will be influenced by the scope of the open data initiative, as well as the extent of relevant work, such as digitisation of data, which needs to be done before the programme starts.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"aid2waystoestimatecostsa\"><a id=\"2\">Ways to estimate costs</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/marfis75/14481855815/\" title=\"decisions ( #cc )\"><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3879/14481855815_cfbc4e0c41_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" alt=\"decisions ( #cc )\"></a></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/marfis75/14481855815/\">Image by Martin Fisch, CC by SA 2.0</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>\n<p>Cost estimates are a necessary part of any government initiative: open data programmes will need to be budgeted for, and can then be considered by decision makers. </p>\n<p>Cost estimates are typically required for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allocating budget(s) for the open data initiative - both for the central team and within individual ministries, departments or agencies. </li>\n<li>Budgets usually need to reflect the additional and specific resources required for a project; they would not usually need to reflect the cost of using existing resources unless further capacity was required.</li>\n<li>A business case for the open data initiative. These generally reflect the value of all resources consumed by the project  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Case study:</em></strong> <em>In 2010 the UK Government decided that individual payments by each ministry would be published as open data. Ministries were instructed to do this within their existing budgets, so there was no additional budgetary cost. However, to evaluate the effectiveness of the initiative, it was necessary to estimate the resources consumed from the existing budgets.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Different resource types</strong></p>\n<p>In addition while some organisations treat staff and non-staff resources both as costs, some organisations control staff in terms of numbers of posts and non-staff resources in financial terms. In the latter case staff resources may not need to be costed, and staff and non-staff provision may not be interchangeable. </p>\n<p><strong>Internal and external resources</strong></p>\n<p>There may be differences between the costs of equivalent services depending on whether they are provided by internal resources or by \"bought-in\" external resources. For instance, external consultants often have a higher day-rate than in-house staff, (although against that needs to be remembered that it should not be necessary to pay for the costs of training of consultants, or for their time while being trained). Conversely external IT resources such as cloud computing may be cheaper than in-house services if government standards for security and resilience do not need to be met. </p>\n<p><strong>Factors impacting on cost profiles</strong></p>\n<p>Some of the required resources for open data initiatives can be purchased in different ways that give different cost profiles over time. For instance an in-house open data platform will typically require up-front expenditure to buy servers and to develop software, whereas a \"software as a service\" may involve lower up-front costs but higher recurrent costs.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"aid3thephasesofanopendatainitiativea\"><a id=\"3\">The phases of an open data initiative</a></h3>\n<p>A typical open data initiative consists of a series of stages:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/b7/85/55b78510d0d46207bc00000a/2015-07-28_12-38-09.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"55b78510f362be77aa00001b\"> </p>\n<p>In addition, an open data initiative should have a number of evaluations and reviews to assess progress and to make recommendations for further improvements.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"aid4preliminarystagea\"><a id=\"4\">Preliminary stage</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/pinksherbet/4269396864/\" title=\"JJ's Beautiful Mess free creative commons\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4039/4269396864_b8c6cda9f1_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" alt=\"JJ's Beautiful Mess free creative commons\"></a></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/pinksherbet/4269396864/\">Image by Pink Sherbet Photography, CC by 2.0</a></em></p>\n<p>The preliminary stage is crucial for securing political and administration support and for developing the business case for an open data initiative. In addition, resources will need to be assigned to develop a strategy for building an initiative, and for the securing of financial and other resources which would implement the strategy. The stage normally starts with a senior decision maker authorising exploratory work and normally ends with a political declaration to launch the open data initiative. This process takes at least six months, and often at least a year.</p>\n<p>Once political support for the exploration of the feasibility of an open data initiative has been secured (for example a statement of support, or an Open Government Partnership Action Plan), there needs to be an assessment of the action required. An example of this would be the <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/1/odra_v3_methodology-en.pdf\">Open Data Readiness Assessment</a>, developed by the World Bank (<a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/1/odra_v3_userguide-en.pdf\">a detailed user guide is also online</a>). Other methodologies, such as the ODI’s Strategic Assessment, have been developed.</p>\n<p>The assessment must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Define the objectives of the initiative in terms of the desired outcomes and benefits</li>\n<li>Identify the stakeholders, and survey their views and concerns</li>\n<li>Assess existing capability within the government and in civil society </li>\n<li>Develop a strategy to implement a successful open data initiative</li>\n<li>Assign responsibilities for implementation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This study may be done internally, by external consultants, or by a combination of resources. Financial provision would need to be made for any external resources; it may also be required to secure any necessary dedicated in-house resources.</p>\n<p>The results of the assessment will inform the second stage of the preliminary stage: planning. This planning will require internal resources, as well as possible involvement of external experts to provide strategic advice. The team would need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Secure political agreement for the open data initiative </li>\n<li>Produce a detailed strategy for the initiative, and a detailed project plan to achieve it.</li>\n<li>Secure agreement to the estimated financial and resource requirements</li>\n<li>Recruit and train key members of the central team to take the initiative forward</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"aid5developmentstagea\"><a id=\"5\">Development stage</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/telachhe/3342173731/\" title=\"Learning to Walk\"><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3367/3342173731_d28727d903_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" alt=\"Learning to Walk\"></a></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/telachhe/3342173731/\">Image by Tela Chhe, CC by 2.0</a></em></p>\n<p>Once the initiative’s strategy is set, the staff need to work on developing the detailed policy and processes, creating the open data portal, and building up the team’s capacity through training and personal development. Lastly, the team will need to prioritise those datasets that should be released first. These datasets would need to be easy to open in the early stages of the initiative. When the portal has been developed and launched, it will then be a platform for the datasets. </p>\n<p>This period of time is about building momentum, making rapid advances whilst developing a solid foundation to develop into a larger initiative. Both internal and external stakeholders must be engaged to gain a better idea of how to build the initiative.</p>\n<p><strong>Central team</strong></p>\n<p>Most successful open data initiatives have a small \"central team\" to lead and co-ordinate the work. The team’s staff should have a range of skills and experience, particularly policy, developer, and project management specialists. The team would be responsible for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Development of detailed policy, processes and standards</li>\n<li>Selection or drafting of a suitable open licence</li>\n<li>Development of any necessary legislation</li>\n<li>Securing political and legislative approvals as necessary</li>\n<li>Sponsorship of the development of the \"open data portal\"</li>\n<li>Communicating the work of the initiative within government, including briefing political sponsors, and raising external awareness.</li>\n<li>Arranging suitable training and capacity building for other ministries (and themselves)</li>\n<li>Liaison with other agencies, external stakeholders, and international partners</li>\n<li>Project and programme management</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The size and required skills of the central team will depend on a variety of factors. Firstly, whether other central agencies can support the initiative by committing their own resources (for example if the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer/eGovernment Unit are willing to develop technical standards as part of their existing responsibilities). </p>\n<p>Secondly, the balance of responsibilities between the central team and individual agencies (for instance, responsibilities for the publication tasks such as putting metadata onto the portal and actually putting the data online). In many initiatives, the central team take on a relatively high level of responsibility during the development phase: while the platforms and processes are under development and while capability is limited across government. The central team then devolves responsibility to individual agencies during the roll-out phase and takes on a co-ordination and management role.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, the pace and ambition of the initiative. The greater the ambition, and the shorter the period of time for launch, the greater the need for dedicated resources. </p>\n<p>Lastly, the extent to which team members have other responsibilities. In general, it is better to have a smaller number of dedicated staff than a larger number of staff who must balance other responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Many open data initiatives have been successfully launched with a central team of 4-10 full-time staff. The number of staff has depended on the extent to which they have been able to get colleagues within government to deliver on their behalf. Some single \"open data co-ordinators\" have reported being overwhelmed; and it can be difficult to find all the necessary policy, technical and management skills in any one individual.</p>\n<p><strong>Governance</strong></p>\n<p>The central team is usually overseen by a steering committee or advisory board within government. Normally this does not involve extra costs - members of the committee are appointed as part of their normal responsibilities. However, some initiatives involve external stakeholders in their steering committee and funding may be required for their expenses or, exceptionally, for honorariums. </p>\n<p><strong>Portal</strong></p>\n<p>Most open data initiatives create a portal: a single web presence where people can find open government data and associated information. The detailed options for a portal are outside the scope of this paper, but there are three broad approaches and each has a different cost profile.</p>\n<p>A <strong>custom web development</strong> would incur initial costs of design and software development. There would also be costs associated with the negotiation and award of contracts to a development company or the management of developers. All these costs would be incurred in the development period. There would also be ongoing hosting costs.</p>\n<p>There are several <strong>established packages</strong> for open data portals. Most leading packages are \"open source\" so there is no cost of software purchase or recurrent software licensing fee. However, using a package does incur installation costs, initial customisation costs (if required), and web design and branding. These costs would all be incurred in the development period. There would also be hosting costs (see below).</p>\n<p>There are a number of established <strong>\"software as a service\"</strong> providers who provide cloud-based open data portals for a recurrent fee (which may be related to the volumes of data or other parameters). Some initial setup, web design and branding services may or may not be provided free. There would also be costs associated with the negotiation and award of a contract to the service provider.</p>\n<p>Different approaches to portal software also lead to different hosting requirements and costs. Hosting of a \"software as a service\" is usually part of the service, but for other approaches hardware and associated services would be required. The options would include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use of existing government resources or IT service contracts</li>\n<li>Purchase of new hardware, with associated installation and commissioning costs</li>\n<li>Use of cloud services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It should be emphasised that different portal approaches alter not only the total cost but also the distribution of costs among the development phase, the rollout phase and the business as usual phase. It is important to allow for all these costs over the whole lifecycle of the initiative.</p>\n<p><strong>Training and capacity building</strong></p>\n<p>During the development phase, costs may also be incurred in training staff in the necessary skills to drive the initiative forward. Learning from the experience of others is an important contribution to success. These could include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Training of the central team in open data concepts, including study visits or international courses (<a href=\"http://theodi.org/courses\">such as those offered by the ODI</a>) </li>\n<li>Training central team staff in the management of the open data portal </li>\n<li>Training relevant staff (central team and any staff from relevant data owning agencies) in the necessary skills to publish data and in the use of the portal software </li>\n<li>Training data publishers in the skills necessary for the preparation of \"quick win\" datasets for publication, including ensuring they comply with privacy and security legislation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Publishing initial \"quick win\" datasets</strong></p>\n<p>Most open data initiatives launch their portal with a credible but limited number of datasets. These are often datasets that are relatively easy to prepare for publication and that do not raise difficult policy questions. For instance, they may include datasets already available in printed form but now made available in re-usable form. Therefore, the costs of preparing each dataset for publication should not be significant and should be contained within existing budgets of the data-owning ministry. </p>\n<p>However, uploading the datasets to the portal and completing the metadata can be time-consuming if there are a significant number of datasets to do in a short time, and allowance may need to be made for that. Sometimes the loading of the initial datasets is done by the central team themselves, and so allowance for the task to be done in a short time needs to be made in the staffing of the team. Spread out over a period and across data-publishing agencies this cost might be contained within existing roles.</p>\n<p><strong>Communications and engagement</strong></p>\n<p>The central team will need to ensure communications and engagement with various stakeholders in open data, for example government, businesses, civil society organisations, and the academic community. Provision for this should be made in the staffing of the central team. They should also be able to leverage professional communication skills from elsewhere in their sponsor organisation. However it may be necessary to make financial provision for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stakeholder meetings or events to discuss the plans for the open data initiative</li>\n<li>A basic web presence explaining the initiative</li>\n<li>Promotional materials and work to engage with journalists, civil society organisations etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition the budget should provide for a launch event to launch the portal and the initial collection of datasets. This would need to cover any costs associated with venue, catering, advertising and attendee management. </p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"aid6rolloutstagea\"><a id=\"6\">Roll-out stage</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/3868098329/\" title=\"Reflections\"><img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2632/3868098329_2664251c3d_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"499\" alt=\"Reflections\"></a></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/alper/3868098329/\">Image by Alper Çuğun, CC by 2.0</a></em></p>\n<p>During this stage, individual ministries will prepare and publish increasing amounts of their data. Processes surrounding the release of open data will be improved and be operated by a wider range of officials. The use of open data will be promoted to build a more sustainable initiative.</p>\n<p><strong>Central team</strong></p>\n<p>The staffing and skills required in the central team will be different in the roll-out phase. The emphasis will evolve from directly-performed tasks to the co-ordination of the release of data by agencies, the management of the overall initiative and the continuing development of policy and standards. This may be more time-consuming than previously because the scale of the initiative will have increased significantly.</p>\n<p>The central team may need to be resourced to perform additional tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Being a central point to receive and handle requests for data, including negotiating with data-owning agencies on what data can be published</li>\n<li>Promoting data liberalisation across the government and persuading agencies to release their data (including helping allies within those agencies convince their colleagues)</li>\n<li>Dealing with difficult (or precedent-setting) cases of data release including privacy and anonymisation, national security concerns and other issues</li>\n<li>Conducting external communications and presentations to encourage the use of data, and dealing with questions from potential data users or others in the \"open data ecosystem\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Governance</strong></p>\n<p>Continuing provision would need to be made for governance costs on a similar basis as during the development phase. The central team can use some of the governance team to share the communications load, so provision should be made for any necessary expenses. The governance team can participate in communications work, and their positions would give them a wider audience. </p>\n<p><strong>Portal operation</strong></p>\n<p>Financial provision should be made for the operating costs of the portal. The budget will depend on the portal approach chosen: it may include hosting costs, system support and software maintenance, and recurrent charges to the service provider. Some \"software as a service\" portals have thresholds for number of datasets or for traffic levels, beyond which charges may increase; it is important to allow for these.</p>\n<p><strong>Portal improvement</strong></p>\n<p>Many open data portals are launched as \"betas\". It would be prudent to allow some budget for additional developments for increased functionalities, design and user experience improvements, and optimisation in the light of analytics and user feedback. Even for a “software as a service” approach, this is likely to be charged-for work.</p>\n<p><strong>Preparing datasets for publication</strong></p>\n<p>There are a number of costs associated with preparing additional datasets for publication after the initial launch of the portal. The organisational structure will influence where the responsibility of publishing data lies. After the initial launch, many open data initiatives transfer more of the day-to-day tasks of publishing data to individual agencies once they have been trained. This work may require additional budget or may be containable within the existing resources of the agencies concerned; if the work is done by the central team the cost will normally materialise into additional budgetary requirements.</p>\n<p>The tasks may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Digitisation of paper records or upgrading of data systems </li>\n<li>Development of software and processes to extract data from operational systems</li>\n<li>Privacy and security assessments</li>\n<li>Redaction, anonymisation or other modification of the data</li>\n<li>Creating metadata</li>\n<li>Uploading the data onto the portal and attaching the metadata</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Open data resources within individual agencies</strong></p>\n<p>Many open data initiatives use a \"hub and spoke\" organisational model for the roll-out and subsequent phases, with the central team being complemented by focal points in each participating agency. An agency’s focal point would typically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Co-ordinate publication of data within that agency</li>\n<li>Arrange training and other capacity building for the agency’s staff</li>\n<li>Handle the uploading of the agency’s data</li>\n<li>Engage with the users of that agency’s data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These tasks are sometimes conducted as part of an existing role, for example by an Access To Information officer or IT manager, and may not require additional budget.</p>\n<p><strong>Training and capacity building</strong></p>\n<p>During the roll-out phase there will be additional costs in training and capacity building across a widening range of agencies. These could include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Training relevant staff in agencies, such as \"focal points\", in the necessary skills to publish data and in the use of the portal software</p></li>\n<li><p>Training relevant staff in agencies on methods of data publication</p></li>\n<li><p>Development of specialist skills, such as effective anonymisation</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Loss of income from data</strong></p>\n<p>Agencies that currently charge for data may need to make provision for the net loss of income to the agency. Whether a loss of income would need to be funded can be a complex issue, and will depend on factors such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whether the agency retained any income (in some jurisdictions any income has to be remitted to the Ministry of Finance centrally)</li>\n<li>What savings could be made by ceasing to charge - for instance sales and marketing, account management, banking and other financial charges and enforcement of intellectual property rights.</li>\n<li>How much lost income from data can be recovered from charges for value-added services (for instance making information about registered companies free and slightly increasing charge for company registration).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most open data initiatives do not make a central provision for loss of income and prefer to address questions of loss of income on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p><strong>Promoting data re-use</strong></p>\n<p>To sustain the effective use of open data, initiatives should include a budgetary provision to promote and facilitate demand. This may cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The appointment of an \"Open Data Champion\" to promote the availability of open data and its use</li>\n<li>Hackathons and other developer-orientated events</li>\n<li>Innovation challenges and competitions, for instance Open Data Challenge Series</li>\n<li>Seed capital to turn a small number of compelling concepts into startups as exemplars </li>\n<li>Business round-tables or other events of engaging potential business users with open data from selected agencies</li>\n<li>Capacity building and awareness raising to promote the re-use of data within government </li>\n<li>Sponsorship of an arms-length/independent body to promote the use and re-use of open data (such as an ODI \"node\")</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"aid7businessasusualstagea\"><a id=\"7\">Business as usual stage</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/byzantiumbooks/14602198884/\" title=\"open neon\"><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3912/14602198884_ac1d0f447a_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"378\" alt=\"open neon\"></a></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/byzantiumbooks/14602198884/\">Image by Bill Smith, CC by 2.0</a></em></p>\n<p>In this stage the publication and updating of data is part of the normal business of government and largely accomplished as part of standard procedures, although (as with Freedom of Information) a small unit may still be needed to ensure that the policy and processes keep up with requirements and that the open data portal is working effectively to meet its objectives.</p>\n<p>The first year of the roll-out stage will inform the strategy of the business as usual stage.

The Apps and websites that we find most useful depend on being able to get hold of information that other organisations have.</p>\n<p>For example, if you want to catch a bus, the App that you turn to needs to know the locations of the nearest bus stops, the routes of the buses that stop at those stops, their timetables (to see when they're supposed to come) and preferably up-to-the-minute data about whether three are going to arrive at once.</p>\n<p>All this information is stored and maintained by different organisations. Often it is replicated by more than one organisation. For example, Transport for London might know all the information about the buses in London, but so do the bus operators.</p>\n<h2 id=\"informationhoarding\"> Information hoarding</h2>\n<p>At the moment, information is often hoarded by organisations such that no one else can use it, or only made available to others for a steep fee. This is bad because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>lots of Apps and websites that we would find useful require information that simply isn't available; you couldn't have an App that helped you catch a bus if the App developer couldn't find out where the bus stops were</li>\n<li>lots of organisations end up collecting and maintaining the same information rather than sharing it, which is a lot of wasted effort; we end up with lots of lists of bus stops, all slightly different, used by different companies and giving you conflicting information</li>\n<li>if someone wants to write an App, they have to shell out some money not only to buy the information they need but also for lawyers to check that they are using it legally; when someone is writing an App in their spare time, trying to get a new company off the ground, they really can't afford that</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"freedata\"> Free data</h2>\n<p>Open data changes this. When an organisation collects information about things other than individual people, it can make that information available for anyone else to use, for free. That means other organisations don't have to make their own copies any more, and App developers don't have to pay a big fee to start using the data.</p>\n<p>What other services could you build if data were open? Here are just a few ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nearest stock</strong> — Ever needed to find the final missing ingredient for a special dinner, and tramped from shop to shop looking for it before finally giving up? If shops opened up information about what they\u0002stock, applications could point you to the nearest one that has the item you’re looking for. You’d find it easier to get the things you need, and the shops that stocked them would benefit from your custom.</li>\n<li><strong>Moving house</strong> — There are so many factors to think about when moving house: nearest transport links, school catchment areas and supermarkets. Applications that bring this information together could help you choose where to live, and keep you posted on homes that become available for rent or sale in those areas.

If information about flood zones and risk were available for free, entrepreneurs could offer a service that texted you with a warning as soon as a warning was issued that could affect your house.</li>\n<li><strong>School links</strong> — Teachers could use information about school performance and local demographics to locate schools with similar pupil profiles that perform significantly better in particular subject areas, and then trade tips, tricks and materials to help them improve their own provision.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"futurepotential\"> Future potential</h2>\n<p>The benefits to the public are just the start though: with more information available, companies, local authorities and government can start making more sensible decisions about the things they do.

For data to be open it <a href=\"http://theodi.org/guides/what-open-data\">must be published under an open licence</a>. A clearly indicated licence sets out what people can and can’t do with the data, enabling use, adaptation and redistribution by anyone or any organisation.</p>\n<p>While lots of licences aim to be \"open\", the terms they include may fall short of actually being \"open\" data, or can make reuse of their data very difficult. This guide explains some common licence terms publishers use that may not fit the definition of \"open data\" or which make open reuse practically impossible.</p>\n<p>In order to make an informed decision publishers must have a clear understanding of what they hope to achieve by opening up their data, the ways they will hope it will be used, and the types of users they wish to engage.</p>\n<p>The ODI <a href=\"http://theodi.org/guides/publishers-guide-open-data-licensing\">open data licensing guide</a> outlines the key considerations that inform licensing decisions, including how to select between the existing standard open licences.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://opendefinition.org/\">Open Definition</a> provides an agreed standard definition of open works and open licences. It clearly describes the licensing terms that must be included in an open licence. There are still many datasets published under licences that do not meet the terms of this definition. Publishers should have an awareness of the impact of specific licensing terms on whether their data is open and whether it can be easily reused by others.</p>\n<p>The Open Definition differentiates between required and acceptable terms that may be included in licences applied to open works and datasets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Required terms</strong> are licensing permissions that must be present in order for a licence to be considered open. </li>\n<li><strong>Acceptable terms</strong> are those which may be included in a licence, so long as they don’t otherwise conflict with the basic definitions of openness. These terms typically place restrictions on how data is reused by placing limitations on the forms of its reuse.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, the abilities to use and redistribute data are <em>required</em> provisions, while attribution and sharealike provisions are <em>acceptable</em>.</p>\n<p>This document provides guidance for open data publishers on some of the issues that both they and consumers of their data will face if data is published under a licence, or via other terms and conditions, that include restrictive terms. </p>\n<p>The guidance should be useful to publishers who are considering opening up their first dataset, and those who may want to understand why their data isn't being used as widely as possible.</p>\n<p>Each of the following sections discusses the impacts of a different licensing term or method of granting rights to reusers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"noderivativesrestrictions\">No-derivatives restrictions</h2>\n<p>A \"no-derivatives\" clause on a licence means that a reuser of the data cannot redistribute any changes that they make to a dataset. This provision is often added to ensure that a redistributed dataset is not materially different from its original source, addressing concerns that data may be misrepresented or distorted.</p>\n<p>However, a publisher would need to enforce this clause for it to have real weight, requiring time and effort to police reuse. Concerns over misrepresentation are adequately addressed by \"non-endorsement\" clauses common to many open licences: these prohibit reusers from suggesting that derived data or analysis has any official status and clarifies that the data publisher does not endorse the actions of its reusers.</p>\n<p>More seriously, no-derivatives clauses will stop reusers from performing a number of useful activities and then making the results available to others, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fixing errors in the data</li>\n<li>enriching a dataset with additional data, eg that they are contributing themselves as additional open data</li>\n<li>mixing or mashing up the dataset with other sources in order to create a more useful dataset, eg by adding extra columns or identifiers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ability to take advantage of this type of activity is a key benefit of publishing open data: reusers are able to transform and mashup a dataset without requiring the original publisher to invest effort in supporting every possible format or linking their data with lots of different sources.</p>\n<p>Discouraging <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect\">network effects</a> around their data is not in the best interests of data publishers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"noncommercialrestrictions\">Non-commercial restrictions</h2>\n<p>A non-commercial provision on a licence requires that the user of a dataset may only use the dataset for \"non-commercial\" purposes. This provision is often added by publishers seeking to restrict the ability for others to exploit the publisher’s investment in data by creating business models or products around a dataset.</p>\n<p>A non-commercial provision is problematic primarily because of a lack of clarity around what constitutes \"commercial\" usage. The Creative Commons licences themselves do not offer a clear definition with the result that the meaning may vary depending on the jurisdiction within which the licence is being used or contested. Definitions of commercial usage often refer to the gaining of \"commercial advantage\" or financial remuneration, without regard to the moral goals of the reuse.</p>\n<p>For example, academic research that is partially supported by private funding, even where undertaken without the intention to exploit any discoveries commercially, may not be considered \"non-commercial\". Without a clear definition these reusers of the data cannot be sure that their intended use is compliant with the terms of a licence.</p>\n<p>Some or all of the following may be considered commercial usage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A free-to-access not-for-profit application or service built using the data, but which uses advertising revenue or sponsorship to help cover operational costs</li>\n<li>A company using the data in a demonstration or showcase of the features for a commercial application or tool</li>\n<li>A company that uses the data to provide a mixture of for-profit and not-for-profit services to customers</li>\n<li>A company using the data to provide a useful paid-for service to not-for-profit organisations, researchers or government</li>\n<li>A research organisation using a dataset in a product that may be later commercialised</li>\n<li>Use of a dataset, eg embedding or visualisation, on a personal blog whose free hostings is covered by advertising revenue, such as on Wordpress.com  </li>\n<li>Use of a dataset by an organisation, eg a university, that draws revenues from commercial services, including training</li>\n<li>Reporting of key figures from a dataset in a print or online newspaper</li>\n<li>Use of a dataset by a company in a way that isn’t tied to revenue generation, eg to improve internal reporting</li>\n<li>Use of a dataset by a commercial organisation to enrich other data that may then be published openly</li>\n<li>Use of a dataset by a charity or other non-research organisation that has a commercial arm</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As an example of the confusion that relates to non-commercial provisions, a ruling in a 2014 court case in Germany found that a non-commercial provision meant that content (and data) <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140326/11405526695/german-court-says-creative-commons-non-commercial-licenses-must-be-purely-personal-use.shtml\">could only be used for personal use</a>. As a result, in Germany a non-commercial provision might limit all organisational uses of a dataset.</p>\n<p>Data licensed with a non-commercial provision cannot legitimately be mixed with datasets licensed with certain other requirements. As noted in the next section, it is not possible to combine a dataset with a non-commercial provision with one that uses a sharealike requirement (unless that licence also contains a non-commercial restriction).</p>\n<p>A non-commercial provision is also \"viral\" in the sense that derived datasets will automatically inherit the non-commercial clause. </p>\n<p>Ultimately, as with the no-derivatives, non-commercial use clauses greatly limit the ability for reusers to remix, enrich and share a dataset.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sharealikerequirements\">Sharealike requirements</h2>\n<p>A \"sharealike\" provision on a licence requires that anyone creating a derived dataset must release that new dataset under exactly the same or similar terms as the original. This provision is often added to try to force others to also release their data under an open licence.</p>\n<p>A downside to sharealike provisions is that they can actually hinder open data adoption as they can result in data being less open than intended. For example, if a dataset is used to create an analysis that results in a new dataset, the analyst cannot place their results into the public domain or choose only attribution: they must use the original licence terms. The user is restricted in how they can share the results of their work.</p>\n<p>Licences that use both sharealike terms and other restrictive terms, eg non-commercial, impose further limitations on reusers. For example, it is not possible to legally create a derived dataset that mixes together a dataset published under the CC-BY-SA and CC-BY-SA-NC licences. The licences are fundamentally incompatible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"attributionrequirements\">Attribution requirements</h2>\n<p>Attribution terms in a licence are an acceptable part of publishing open data. They require that users of the data acknowledge the source of the data, typically by providing an agreed attribution statement and a relevant link in their application or service.</p>\n<p>While the attribution requirements are not onerous there are occasions where attribution can restrict the freedom of data users:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The attribution requirements may be undocumented or unclear, leaving users uncertain how to comply with the licensing terms</li>\n<li>The requirements may be very prescriptive, eg requiring that users display the attribution statement using a specific size of font or to display a logo that may be difficult to comply with across all devices (including mobile and embedded devices) and products that use the data</li>\n<li>When an application uses many different datasets, then the list of attribution statements may be very long so displaying them, eg on every page or screen in an application, isn't practical</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Attribution norms often differ between communities. Within the scientific community data attribution is often specified as a formal citation, as used in an academic paper, that lists all of the authors or contributors to the data. In other communities only the name of the publisher and a link to the dataset are required.</p>\n<p>While we encourage attribution as a norm for open data reusers, publishers are encouraged to be both clear and flexible around their requirements. </p>\n<p>For example, the <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/\">UK Open Government Licence</a> was recently updated to include a default attribution statement and additional guidance for reusers publishing attribution statements for multiple datasets. The ODI <a href=\"http://theodi.org/guides/publishers-guide-to-the-open-data-rights-statement-vocabulary\">guide to publishing machine-readable rights statements</a> also includes some suggestions on designing attribution requirements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"apitermsandconditions\">API terms and conditions</h2>\n<p>Publishers providing APIs that allow developers to query a dataset may consider adopting an open approach by amending their API to provide a \"free tier\" of usage. Free tiers typically allow anyone to use an API to make a fixed number of queries, eg per day or per hour. Higher usage tiers often require commercial agreements in place. This method of access is potentially a component of an open data business model.</p>\n<p>API terms and conditions are typically bespoke and are lengthy to read. While there are a number of off-the-shelf open licences, there are no off-the-shelf API terms. Developers signing up to use a free access tier in an API are obliged to understand how the specific terms and conditions will impact their intended use of the data.</p>\n<p>API terms also tend to be geared towards describing the terms of the service being provided to the user rather than the terms of use of the data being delivered via that service. As a result the delivered data is often unclearly licensed.</p>\n<p>Ideally the terms and conditions for an API would identify the data licence for the delivered data separately from the terms of service. Whatever tier of usage, whether free or paid, the retrieved data would then still be covered by an open licence.</p>\n<p>If the API places restrictions on how the data is used such that it doesn't conform to the Open Definition then data exposed by the API cannot be considered to be open.</p>\n<p>Some types of data, in particular data that is updated in real time or near-real time, can only be published effectively via an API or feed. However, \"static\" datasets that are only accessible via an API, and not available as bulk downloads, are unlikely to be compliant with the Open Definition.</p>\n<h2 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h2>\n<p>Very many thanks to <a href=\"http://www.owenboswarva.com/\">Owen Boswarva</a> and the anonymous commenters who contributed comments on this draft.</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Leigh Dodds","slug":"leigh-dodds","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/leigh-dodds","tag_ids":["team","rnd-programme","staff"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Leigh Dodds","slug":"leigh-dodds","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/leigh-dodds","tag_ids":["team","rnd-programme","staff"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/marking-up-your-dataset-with-dcat.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/guides/marking-up-your-dataset-with-dcat","slug":"marking-up-your-dataset-with-dcat","title":"Marking up your dataset with DCAT ","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:56:19+00:00","created_at":"2014-07-22T10:59:17+00:00","tag_ids":["guide"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/guide.json","web_url":null,"title":"Guide","details":{"description":"Guide","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=guide","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/guide","slug":"guide"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"The [Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT)](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/) defines a standard way to publish machine-readable metadata about a dataset.\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"","url":"","content":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/\">Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT)</a> defines a standard way to publish machine-readable metadata about a dataset.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to publish a description of your dataset is to publish DCAT metadata using RDFa. RDFa allows machine-readable metadata to be embedded in a webpage. This means that publishing your dataset metadata can be easily achieved by updating the HTML for your dataset homepage.</p>\n<p>This guide provides a short introduction to publishing DCAT metadata using RDFa. For more advanced use cases, including publishing data in other formats, take a look at the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/\">official W3C documentation for DCAT</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/\">RDFa primer</a> may also be useful background reading.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://certificates.theodi.org\">Open Data Certificates</a> application supports reading DCAT published as RDFa. So as well as providing machine-readable metadata for data consumers, using DCAT will simplify the process of certifying your dataset as the application will be able to automatically populate some of the answers for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gettingstarted\">Getting started</h2>\n<p>The first thing to do is to let applications know that your web page is describing a dataset. To do this we need to declare the metadata schemas we will be using to describe the dataset and then indicate the type of thing being described.</p>\n<p>Here is a fragment of HTML that provides a starting point. Replace <code>{url}</code> with the URL of your dataset page.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;html prefix=\"dct: http://purl.org/dc/terms/\n              rdf: http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\n              dcat: http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#\n              foaf: http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\"&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;    \n        &lt;div typeof=\"dcat:Dataset\" resource=\"{url}\"&gt;\n        ...\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>html</code> element has a <code>prefix</code> attribute that declares the schemes. The <code>div</code> element declares which resource it is describing and the type of resource using the <code>resource</code> and <code>typeof</code> attributes.</p>\n<p>The rest of the metadata about the dataset will then be added to HTML elements nested inside this container <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. You don't have to use a <code>div</code> element, it could be any HTML element, so adapt this to the structure of your dataset's page.</p>\n<p>The following sections each illustrate how to add extra metadata elements that flesh out the description of your dataset. Try and provide as full a description of your dataset as possible.</p>\n<p>Again, the HTML elements used in the examples are just a suggestion, they can be anything you want, so adapt the examples to your existing page. You may need to add some extra elements, e.g. to wrap dates, titles, etc .that are already in the page as plain-text.</p>\n<p>The important part of the examples are the RDFa attributes: <code>about</code>, <code>property</code>, <code>content</code>, <code>datatype</code>, etc. These attributes define what property of the dataset is being described and provide the machine-readable metadata.</p>\n<h3 id=\"title\">Title</h3>\n<p>Specify the title for your dataset using the <code>dct:title</code> property:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;h1 property=\"dct:title\"&gt;Example Dataset&lt;/h1&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"datecreated\">Date created</h3>\n<p>Specify the date your dataset was created using the <code>dct:created</code> property:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;p property=\"dct:created\" content='2010-10-25T09:00:00+00:00' datatype='xsd:dateTime'&gt;25th October 2010&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case the human-readable text for the property is contained within the paragraph tag. It's value can be anything, but the machine readable date (specified in the <code>content</code> attribute), must use a defined data type so it can be easily parsed. </p>\n<p>It's recommended that you use the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#date\">XML Schema date</a> or <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime\">XML schema dateTime format</a> format.</p>\n<h3 id=\"datemodified\">Date modified</h3>\n<p>Specify the date your dataset was last updated using the <code>dct:modified</code> property:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;p property=\"dct:modified\" content='2010-10-25T09:00:00+00:00' datatype='xsd:dateTime'&gt;25th October 2010&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>See above for notes on the date formats.</p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>Markup the description of your dataset using the <code>dct:description</code> property:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;p property=\"dct:description\"&gt;This is the description.&lt;p&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"license\">License</h3>\n<p>The markup for declaring your dataset license is slightly more complex. You need to declare the license property (<code>dct:license</code>) as well as the name and URL for the license:</p>\n<p>Substitute the <code>{license URL}</code> and <code>{license name}</code> placeholders for the values that apply to your dataset.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div property=\"dct:license\" \n     resource=\"{license URL}\"&gt;\n  &lt;a href=\"{license URL}\"&gt;\n    &lt;span property=\"dct:title\"&gt;{license name}&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>For a more detailed guide on publishing a comprehensive rights statement for your dataset, including license, copyright statements and preferred form of attribution read the <a href=\"http://theodi.org/guides/publishers-guide-to-the-open-data-rights-statement-vocabulary\">Publishers Guide to the Open Data Rights Statement Vocabulary</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"publisher\">Publisher</h3>\n<p>Declare the publisher of your dataset using the <code>dct:publisher</code> property. Again, there are several elements to declare here including the name and homepage URL for the publisher.</p>\n<p>Replace the <code>publisher URL</code> and <code>publisher name</code> properties with the appropriate values.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div property=\"dct:publisher\" \n     resource=\"{publisher URL}\"&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\"{publisher URL}\" about=\"{publisher URL}\" property=\"foaf:homepage\"&gt;\n        &lt;span property=\"foaf:name\"&gt;{publisher name}&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"keywords\">Keywords</h3>\n<p>Keywords can be attached to a dataset using the <code>dcat:keyword</code> property. The property values are simple labels or tags. You can have as many or as few (or none!) of these as you want.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;span property=\"dcat:keyword\"&gt;Examples&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span property=\"dcat:keyword\"&gt;DCAT&lt;/span&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"updatefrequency\">Update frequency</h3>\n<p>The <code>dcat:accrualPeriodicity</code> property is used to define how often a dataset is updated. The values for the property are URIs which are taken a simple controlled vocabulary.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"{frequency}\" property=\"dcat:accrualPeriodicity\"&gt;{frequency (human readable)}&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Substitute the <code>{frequency}</code> placeholder with one of the following URIs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/code#freq-A</code> - Annual</li>\n<li><code>http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/code#freq-B</code> - Every working day (Mon - Fri)</li>\n<li><code>http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/code#freq-D</code> - Daily (7 days a week)</li>\n<li><code>http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/code#freq-M</code> - Monthly</li>\n<li><code>http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/code#freq-N</code> - Every minute</li>\n<li><code>http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/code#freq-Q</code> - Every quarter</li>\n<li><code>http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/code#freq-S</code> - Half yearly</li>\n<li><code>http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/code#freq-W</code> - Weekly</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"distributions\">Distributions</h3>\n<p>A dataset can have a number of distributions. <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#class-distribution\">Distributions</a> describe how a dataset is packaged and released. Your dataset may have several distributions, e.g. if you publish a series of data over a period of time as separate packages, or if it is available in different formats.</p>\n<p>The markup here is a little more complex. It defines a new resource (a <code>dcat:Distribution</code>) and associates that with your dataset. The nested markup then provides metadata about the new resource, e.g. its format, size, publication date, etc.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div property='dcat:distribution' typeof='dcat:Distribution'&gt;\n    &lt;span property=\"dct:title\"&gt;{Distribution title}&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Format&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span content='{format}' property='dcat:mediaType'&gt;{format (human readable)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span content='{size in bytes}' datatype='xsd:decimal' property='dcat:byteSize'&gt;{size (human readable)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issued&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span property='dct:issued' content='{date issued}' datatype='xsd:date'&gt;{date issued (human readable)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;        \n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='{link to data}' property='dcat:accessURL'&gt;Download the full dataset&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;  \n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>{format}</code> placeholder should be a <a href=\"http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml\">recognised MIME type</a>, (for example <code>text/csv</code> or <code>application/json</code>)</p>\n<p>The <code>dct:issued</code> property specifies the date that the distribution was published.

As a re-user of Open Data you should ensure that your usage conforms to those rights. This includes making efforts to ensure that you properly attribute your sources.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://theodi.org/guides/publishers-guide-to-the-open-data-rights-statement-vocabulary\">Publishers Guide to the Open Data Rights Statement Vocabulary</a>, provides an introduction to the ODRS vocabulary and includes a number of worked examples. You should read that guide to familiarise yourself with the basic concepts behind the vocabulary.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/open-data-licensing\">ODRS github project</a> includes some <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/open-data-licensing/tree/master/examples\">additional standalone examples</a> that can be used a further reference.</p>\n<p>This guide provides some advice on how to use metadata published in the ODRS vocabulary within your applications to help simplify the process of attributing and citing the sources of your data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"discoveringrightsstatements\">Discovering Rights Statements</h2>\n<p>Publishers should be exposing structured metadata about their datasets using standard formats such as the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/\">Data Catalog vocabulary</a> (DCAT) or <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/void/\">VoID</a>. </p>\n<p>As described in <a href=\"http://theodi.org/guides/publishers-guide-to-the-open-data-rights-statement-vocabulary\">the publisher guide</a> there are two standard properties that can be used to reference licensing and rights information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>dct:license</code> -- existing practice is for this property to refer to a licence that applies to the dataset</li>\n<li><code>dct:rights</code> -- this property can be used to refer to a <code>odrs:RightsStatement</code> resource that provides a fuller description of a Rights Statement, e.g. licences that refer to both content and data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In most cases these properties will be the starting point for discovering machine-readable rights metadata.</p>\n<p>A <code>odrs:RightsStatement</code> resource may have several properties that can be useful in your application:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>odrs:copyrightNotice</code> and <code>odrs:copyrightStatement</code> properties respectively provide the text or a link to a copyright statement that applies to the dataset you are using. Some licences, including those from the Creative Commons, require you to preserve copyright notices provided by the data publisher. These properties allow you to include a short notice in your application or a link to a fuller copyright statement.</li>\n<li>The <code>attributionText</code> and <code>attributionURL</code> properties provide the means for publishers to describe their preferred form of attribution</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A Rights Statement might be published alongside a description of a dataset, e.g. as embedded metadata expressed using RDFa. However they might also be published separately, e.g. as a standalone web page or document that is referenced by several datasets.</p>\n<p>Rights information can also be referenced directly from individual documents, e.g. using <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287#page-21\">the <code>atom:link</code> element</a> or in an HTML <code>link</code> element. </p>\n<p>Web APIs might also include HTTP <code>Link</code> Headers, as defined by <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988\">RFC 5988</a>, that refer to rights information, e.g:</p>\n<p>Link: <a href=\"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/\">http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/</a>; rel=\"license\", \n       <a href=\"http://api.example.org/docs/rights\">http://api.example.org/docs/rights</a>; rel=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/rights\"</p>\n<p>In short, while the structure of a rights statement is defined by the ODRS vocabulary there are several different locations in which references to that metadata might be included, either along a description of the dataset or by reference. When processing the data in your application you should ensure to fetch any additional resources.</p>\n<p>Rather than hard-coding this metadata into your application you should consider using the data to drive the creation of attribution links and citations. A publisher may need to revise the text or link target and by relying on the (cached) metadata you will be able to use the latest values in your application.</p>\n<h2 id=\"attributingdatasets\">Attributing Datasets</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://theodi.org/guides/publishers-guide-to-the-open-data-rights-statement-vocabulary\">publisher guide</a> includes some background discussion on attribution and citation. While closely related, there are two slightly different use cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Attribution</em> -- giving credit to the creator and/or maintainer of a dataset in order to acknowledge that their contribution to your application</li>\n<li><em>Citation</em> -- linking to a source dataset that you have used in your application, or some analysis, or which are components of a large aggregated dataset that you might be distributing to others</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Attribution is often a legal requirement that is included in Open Data licences. This means that you must attribute your sources to stay within the terms of the licence. In addition you may need to preserve any copyright notices that are provided by the publisher.</p>\n<p>Citation is often more detailed than attribution. A clear provenance statement, e.g. a list of data sources, can help users trust your application or attempt to reproduce your analysis.</p>\n<p>The ODRS vocabulary includes properties that help you to build attribution links, find copyright statements and, as a component of additional dataset metadata, publish structured citations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"buildingattributionlinks\">Building Attribution Links</h3>\n<p>Attribution should be simple and straight-forward. Even when a data license does not require attribution, you should attempt to acknowledge your sources.</p>\n<p>The simplest form of attribution is to include a simple link in your application. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;span&gt;Uses data supplied by &lt;a href=\"http://example.org/attribution-link\"&gt;Example Company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The following steps suggest a simple algorithm for building an attribution link:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Find the text to use as the anchor of the link:<ol>\n<li>If the publisher has provided an <code>odrs:attributionText</code> property then use its value, otherwise</li>\n<li>If the dataset references a publisher via a <code>dct:publisher</code> property then use the <code>foaf:name</code> of the publisher</li>\n<li>If the dataset has a title property (<code>dct:title</code>) then use that</li></ol></li>\n<li>Find the URL to use as the target of the link:<ol>\n<li>If the publisher has provided an <code>odrs:attributionURL</code> property then use that URI, otherwise</li>\n<li>If the dataset references a publisher via a <code>dct:publisher</code> property then use its <code>foaf:homepage</code> property</li>\n<li>If the dataset has a <code>dcat:landingPage</code> property then use that, else</li>\n<li>Use the URI of the dataset</li></ol></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The approach given here is to use the preferred attribution text and URL provided by the publisher but fall back to using other dataset metadata if that is not available. A publisher may wish to direct attribution links to a particular target page to help track usage of their data (to justify ongoing publishing efforts) or to support attribution and acknowledgement of <em>their</em> sources.</p>\n<p>While the example properties used in the algorithm draw heavily on DCAT, it should be possible to customise the behaviour depending on the data format(s) used by the publisher.</p>\n<h3 id=\"displayingcopyrightnotices\">Displaying Copyright Notices</h3>\n<p>Some licenses may require you to display or preserve copyright notices that are provided by data publishers. For example you may need to retain notices when re-distributing data. </p>\n<p>A copyright notice is defined using the <code>copyrightNotice</code> property, and will typically be a short phrase, e.g. <em>© Crown copyright 2013</em>, or <em>Copyright © 2013, Example Ltd</em></p>\n<p>You should also consider displaying any copyright notices found in a rights statement. A simple approach is to include the notice alongside your attribution text and link, e.g.:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;span&gt;Uses data from &lt;a href=\"http://example.org/attribution-link\"&gt;Example Ltd&lt;/a&gt;. © Crown copyright 2013 Example, Ltd.&lt;/span&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>If the data publisher has included a <code>copyrightStatement</code> link, but has not included any notice text, then you can build a link as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;span&gt;Uses data from &lt;a href=\"http://example.org/attribution-link\"&gt;Example Ltd&lt;/a&gt;. \n    &lt;a href=\"http://example.org/attribution-link\"&gt;Copyright Statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>See below for further notes on displaying attribution links and copyright notices.</p>\n<h3 id=\"attributioninlinkeddataapplications\">Attribution in Linked Data Applications</h3>\n<p>If you are building an application that is consuming and displaying Linked Data, then you should also consider providing direct links to the resources that are referenced in your application. E.g. a community traffic monitoring application that uses the Ordnance Survey Linked Data might link directly to individual geographic areas (e.g. <a href=\"http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/7000000000024979\">Bath</a>) that are referenced from collected traffic reports.</p>\n<p>This kind of deep-linking can help highlight which parts of a dataset you are drawing on. This is a more focused type of attribution enabled by Linked Data.</p>\n<p>However this form of attribution is not always feasible. For example if a data view draws from on dozens of different Linked Data sources. For this reason the recommendation is to <em>always</em> include a basic attribution link and add \"deep links\" to Linked Data application on a best effort basis.</p>\n<h3 id=\"displayinglinkstousers\">Displaying Links to Users</h3>\n<p>Attribution links should be displayed as close as possible to where the data is being displayed to a user. However the needs of your application and the limitations of the devices on which it is being used will impact your ability to prominently display attribution links.</p>\n<p>As general guidance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If your application uses a single primary dataset across the whole application, then include an attribution link in the footer of the application, along with any copyright notice provided by the publisher.</li>\n<li>If your application uses several datasets, then consider displaying an attribution link next to a logical grouping of data items. For example if you display an \"infobox\" that provides some additional metadata, then include an attribution link in the footer of the infobox.

Greater trust means less friction when developing new ideas and services, and greater use of existing ones. It facilitates more connections and <a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/comment-what-would-an-open-data-future-look-like\">network effects</a>. It helps consumers feel empowered, and leads to more informed choices about services that involve collection of personal data. Openness makes things better. </p>\n<p>The ODI’s privacy and openness principles set targets for organisations aspiring to build trust in how they manage personal data. The principles focus specifically on how organisations manage personal data, not data in general that they collect and/or use. They’re intended to be broadly applicable to organisations in the public, private and third sectors: organisations of any size who are collecting, storing, using and/or providing access to personal data. </p>\n<p><strong>We want to see organisations committing to the principles and incorporating them into their own organisational policies and processes.</strong></p>\n<p>The principles are not intended to be exhaustive. Some aspects of the principles are already reflected in data protection frameworks, such as the <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:119:FULL\">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> in the European Union, and will become a requirement for many organisations operating in the digital single market. Others extend on existing laws and aspire for greater openness in how personal data is managed. Data protection is sometimes seen as a compliance burden. Openness about how privacy is preserved builds trust, providing both compliance and wider service improvements.</p>\n<p>The principles encourage organisations to commit to being ‘open’ in a number of ways. ‘Open’ means both sharing information (publicly online and directly to people), and being open to feedback from people about how things could be improved. </p>\n<p>Note: these are guiding principles. Organisations should be aware of additional obligations under national data protection laws. </p>\n<h2 id=\"theprinciples-1\">The principles</h2>\n<p><strong>1)</strong> <a id=\"1\"><b>Organisations should be open with people about what personal data they are collecting</b></a></p>\n<p>Organisations should be open with people about what personal data they collect from people and for what purpose – for example whether the data will be used to help deliver a service for them, be linked with other information about them, be shared with other organisations or be used for research purposes. </p>\n<p>This may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Publishing clear and accessible information about what personal data they collect and the purpose of collection at the point at which people sign up for a service</p></li>\n<li><p>Making a register of information available as open data about the personal data they collect, have access to, and why, including where they are receiving access from a third party</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This principle is already reflected in some data protection laws (GDPR, for example). </p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>2)</strong> <a id=\"2\"><b>Organisations should be open with people about how they use personal data</b></a></p>\n<p>Organisations should be publishing information openly about how they use different kinds of personal data, for example to deliver a service, conduct analysis or simply maintain records. They should keep this information up to date. This information is to help people understand how their data is used at a high level, and the level of detail provided should reflect that. </p>\n<p>This may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>An open and regularly updated register of purposes for which they collect and use different kinds of personal data</p></li>\n<li><p>Notifications provided to people who have provided personal data about any changes to how their personal data is being used</p></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>3)</strong> <a id=\"3\"><b>Organisations should be open with people about the way personal data is shared</b></a></p>\n<p>When organisations share personal data with other people or organisations, they should be open about what data exactly they are sharing; with whom; for what purpose; under what conditions; and for what return (eg financial return, or because it’s a necessary part of providing a person with a service). </p>\n<p>This may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>An open and regularly updated dataset on their website detailing what personal data they are sharing; with which organisations or individuals; why; and with what limitations on use</p></li>\n<li><p>Maintaining accurate individual records of how people’s personal data is being shared with other organisations and people – this will enable organisations to reply to requests from people about who has access to their data, and follow through any changes/deletion of that data (this is required, for example, under the GDPR’s <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:119:FULL\">right to be forgotten</a>)</p></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>4)</strong> <a id=\"4\"><b>Organisations should be open with people about the way personal data is secured</b></a></p>\n<p>Organisations should be open about the way personal data is secured, to the extent that is possible without increasing the risk of security breaches.</p>\n<p>This may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Regularly publishing information online about security audits that are carried out, any data breaches that take place, and responses to those breaches. </p></li>\n<li><p>Publishing the details of, and reports from any independent security auditors where it is safe to do so</p></li>\n<li><p>Providing feedback mechanisms for people to get in touch regarding any potential flaws in their data security</p></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>5)</strong> <a id=\"5\"><b>Organisations should explain to people how they make decisions about them using their data</b></a></p>\n<p>If organisations are using algorithms and data to make decisions that impact on an individual’s life, or target services to them in a particular way, they should commit to providing an accessible explanation of how such processes work and the data involved. They should provide a mechanism for people to challenge decisions made about them, or services targeted to them, in a way that is meaningful and involves human interaction. </p>\n<p>This may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Providing information about how decisions are made, and what data has been involved, in any notifications to people (email, post, telephone etc) about decisions that impact them. </p></li>\n<li><p>Creating an arbitration mechanism for people who want to challenge decisions, with information about how to do this publicly available and easily accessible on their website. In some sectors, this challenge mechanism may be best enabled via independent arbitrators. </p></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>6)</strong> <a id=\"6\"><b>Organisations should be open about their accountability mechanisms for misuse of personal data</b></a></p>\n<p>Organisations should publish information about the governance and accountability processes they have in place to monitor best practice management of the personal data they hold. </p>\n<p>This may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>A publicly available overview of the internal decision making process, and the governance model in place, to monitor issues raised with management of personal data</p></li>\n<li><p>Publishing minutes of meetings, and reports of decisions made via these accountability mechanisms</p></li>\n<li><p>Identifying an independent, trusted third party to provide accountability mechanisms on their behalf (with the same requirements of openness)</p></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>7)</strong> <a id=\"7\"><b>Organisations should help people understand and influence how their data is collected and used</b></a></p>\n<p>Organisations should commit to using clear, accessible language in their data policies and permissions to communicate with people what happens to their personal data. Wherever possible, the way they design their services for consumers should provide real choice for them in how their data is accessed, used and shared.</p>\n<p>This may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Designing services with different options regarding the level of personal data that might be collected about a person, and who they could grant access and use permissions to</p></li>\n<li><p>Providing individuals with mechanisms to access their own data (this is required by organisations that need to comply with the GDPR)</p></li>\n<li><p>Providing individuals with mechanisms to <a href=\"https://theodi.org/open-banking-standard\">approve access to their data held by one organisation to another organisation</a> (this is reflected in the right of portability under the GDPR)</p></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>8)</strong> <a id=\"8\"><b>Organisations collecting or using personal data should make their analyses and outputs as open as possible</b></a></p>\n<p>When organisations are undertaking research using personal data, and building or delivering services using personal data, they should as far as possible provide benefit back to the public to reflect the value being provided by them.

These are the ODI‘s principles to guide how data infrastructure can be strengthened to benefit everyone</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/data-infrastructure\">Data is infrastructure</a>. Having a strong data infrastructure will only become more vital as our populations grow and our economies and societies become ever more reliant on getting value from data to meet people’s needs.</p>\n<p>Data infrastructure connects together different parts of our society and economy. Weather data is being used by everyone from farmers to the transport industry to individual citizens. Mapping data is created and shared by the public sector and then built on by diverse organisations, from Google to construction companies to the home insurance industry. People buying a home might use a service that combines data on house prices, schools, transport times and insurance premiums. Data is infrastructure for our cities, nations and globally across each and every sector.</p>\n<p>Society has not learnt the lessons from the evolution of our road, railway and energy networks in the industrial revolution when we realised that while our infrastructure might be created by industrial giants, it had to be managed in a way to maximise benefits to society. To maximise value from data we need data infrastructure to be as open and accessible as possible while respecting privacy. Data could contribute more value to our economies and our lives than it currently does. </p>\n<p>Good infrastructure is simply there when we need it but, at the moment, too much of our data infrastructure is unreliable, inaccessible or only available if you can pay for access. Data innovators struggle to get hold of data and to work out how they can best use it, while individuals do not feel that they are in control of their data.</p>\n<p>Data infrastructure should be as easy to use as our road networks. The time and effort that goes into fixing data infrastructure when the equivalents of potholes, toll booths and missing intersections are discovered would be better spent building services that improve our lives.</p>\n<p>We need to plan for the long-term, learn how to <a href=\"http://theodi.org/data-infrastructure\">strengthen our data infrastructure</a> and build an <a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/comment-what-would-an-open-data-future-look-like\">open future</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"designprinciplesfordatainfrastructure\">Design principles for data infrastructure</h2>\n<p><em>These principles for data infrastructure complement our <a href=\"http://theodi.org/guides/openness-principles-for-organisations-handling-personal-data\">principles for personal data</a>. The personal data principles will help to build services and find insights in ways that people can understand and trust. Data infrastructure provides a foundation that allows those services and insights to flourish. These design principles should be used when that foundation is being designed, built and assessed</em> </p>\n<p>Data infrastructure includes datasets, the <a href=\"http://theodi.org/labs\">technology</a>, <a href=\"http://theodi.org/elearning\">training</a> and <a href=\"https://theodi.org/guides\">processes</a> that makes them useable, policies and regulation such as those for data sharing and protection, and the <a href=\"https://directory.theodi.org/members\">organisations</a> and people that collect, maintain and use data.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Design for open</strong></p>\n<p>Open data, open culture, open standards, open source and collaborative models build trust, reduce cost and create more value than other approaches. Being open improves quality as more people can contribute to the outcome and increases the number of connections that can be made. Data benefits from network effects: it creates more value as more people use, contribute to and maintain it.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Build with the web</strong></p>\n<p>We need to <a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/we-need-to-learn-how-to-search-the-web-of-data\">learn how to publish, discover, use and link together data across the web</a>. Data on and in the web is continuing to grow with more devices being connected and interconnected every day. The billions of people, sensors and services on the web produce and use data. Data infrastructure must support the web of data.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Respect privacy</strong></p>\n<p>In the most impactful and valuable data infrastructure, openness is maximised but what is private remains private. Different countries have their own data protection legislation and social contracts, which need to be adhered to. To build trust organisations using personal data should also be open with people about how they use and share that data.  </p>\n<p><strong>4. Benefit everyone</strong></p>\n<p>Data infrastructure components should be designed and supported to benefit as many stakeholders as may use it. Everyone should benefit from the innovation, services and insights that the whole data infrastructure allows. Sometimes data infrastructure that is as open as possible will benefit the organisations that maintain the data, in other cases <a href=\"http://theodi.org/research-economic-value-open-paid-data\">it will not</a>. To benefit everyone it will be necessary for governments to provide support for some components. </p>\n<p><strong>5. Think big but start small</strong></p>\n<p>Don't start big. Start with the problems that are making it hard for people to make decisions or build new services, be agile and learn from experiments. Concrete and tar don't go out of date as quickly as data technologies do. </p>\n<p><strong>6. Design to adapt</strong></p>\n<p>Expect needs to change, and expect other needs to vary between different stakeholders and local contexts. Be prepared to experiment with new technologies and ideas, look for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path\">desire paths</a>, measure impact, learn from what works and what doesn’t. Any part of data infrastructure might start as a small experiment but turn out to create significant impact and have high demand.

There are lots of aspects to openness, but at its most fundamental, the key is <strong>how the data is licensed</strong>. Data that doesn't explicitly have an open licence is not open data.</p>\n<p>But what does it mean to license data? What licence should you use? How can you indicate the licence that a dataset is available under? This guide answers these questions.</p>\n<p><em>Note: This guide focuses on data published by organisations based in the UK. Licensing law is different in different countries, so some of this information might not apply to you if you are based elsewhere. It does not address other potential legal considerations, such as compliance with the Data Protection Act.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"whatislicensing\">What is licensing?</h2>\n<p>When you put care and thought into creating something, such as writing a blog post or taking a photograph, you own that work and you have certain rights, described below.</p>\n<p>If you have ownership of a work, and someone else wants to use it, they have to ask your permission. <strong>Licences</strong> are how you explicitly give someone else permission to use that work.</p>\n<p>You can <strong>transfer</strong> that ownership, which means that someone else now owns your work and has the rights associated with it. Usually your employment contract will state that work that you do as part of your employment is automatically transferred to your organisation, for example.</p>\n<p>You can also <strong>waive</strong> your rights, which places the work into the public domain and means anyone can do whatever they want with it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatdoyouown\">What do you own?</h3>\n<p>In Europe, there are two kinds of rights that you are automatically given over things that you have created:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you get <strong><a href=\"http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/copy.htm\">copyright</a></strong> over works (<strong>content</strong>) that you create and which are original to you, such as text that you write or photographs you take</li>\n<li>you get a <strong><a href=\"http://www.ipo.gov.uk/c-databaseright.htm\">database right</a></strong> over collections of <strong>data</strong> that you have put a substantial effort into obtaining, verifying or presenting</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note: As far as we know the database right only arises within the European Union and in Mexico. In some countries there may be no protection for collections of data.</em></p>\n<p>If you apply original judgement in putting together a database, for example in choosing which items to include within the database or which information about them to include, you have a copyright over that database, because it is a creative work.</p>\n<p>For example, if you were to build a database about the best 100 cars, this might involve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>choosing which cars count as the best cars</li>\n<li>writing a description about each car</li>\n<li>researching and gathering facts about them</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You would have copyright over the database, because you chose which cars were \"best\". You would have copyright over the descriptions, because you wrote them. And you would probably have the database right for the database you've built, because you put substantial effort into gathering information about them. Importantly, you don't own the facts about the cars — anyone else can build their own database containing exactly those facts without violating your database right — but no one else can reuse your database or your descriptions without your permission because you own the copyright over them.</p>\n<p>You probably do not have a database right if you <em>create</em> the facts in a database, as opposed to gathering them from elsewhere, unless you put substantial effort into verifying or presenting the database. For example, if you own a restaurant and create a database of the dishes that you offer and when you offer them, you probably do not have a database right over that database, though you might have copyright because of the creative judgement involved in working out which dishes should be offered on particular days to provide a balanced menu.</p>\n<p>Copyright and database right are types of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). There are other kinds of IPR that you can get, such as patents, trademarks and (some) design rights, which must be registered (for example with the <a href=\"http://www.ipo.gov.uk/\">Intellectual Property Office</a>).</p>\n<h3 id=\"whataboutdatafromotherorganisations\">What about data from other organisations?</h3>\n<p>You might not own all the content or data that you have and use within your organisation. In particular, rather than creating the content or gathering the data yourself, some of the content and data you hold and use within your organisation, and might want to publish, might be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>completely licensed from someone else</li>\n<li>include an extract of content or data that you have licensed from someone else</li>\n<li>be derived from the content or data that you have licensed from someone else</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <a href=\"/guide/reusers-guide-open-data-licensing\">reuser's guide to open data licensing</a> describes what you can do with content or data that you licence from someone else. If you do reuse that content or data in your own publications, you should indicate the licence under which you are reusing that content, so that people reusing that content or data know what they can do with it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whataboutmybrand\">What about my brand?</h3>\n<p>Organisations who publish content or data under an open licence are often concerned that this might enable reusers to also copy their brand.</p>\n<p>Your brand should be protected through a <a href=\"http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm/t-about/t-whatis.htm\">trade mark</a>. A trade mark restricts how other people use your logo or company name. You will also have copyright on the logo.</p>\n<p>Although your trade mark will protect you from other people using your logo directly, if your logo is incorporated into some content that you licence, you should make sure the logo is explicitly not covered by that licence, as you will usually want to place additional restrictions on its use (such as its adaptation).</p>\n<p>For example, if you have written a report that includes your logo, and you want to licence the content of the report under the Creative Commons Attribution licence, you could say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The text, figures and tables in this report are licensed under a <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode\">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>. Logos and other trade marks are not covered by this licence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"whatifipublishthedataonawebsite\">What if I publish the data on a website?</h3>\n<p>You still have rights over your database and your content when you publish them on a website. Others cannot legally extract and reuse a substantial portion of your data or content without your permission.</p>\n<p>You can also indicate that others should not scrape data from your website through your Terms and Conditions and through technical mechanisms such as <code>robots.txt</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatareopenlicences\">What are open licences?</h2>\n<p>An <strong>open licence</strong> is one that places very few restrictions on what anyone can do with the content or data that is being licensed. An open licence allows others to do things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>republish the content or data on their own website</li>\n<li>derive new content or data from yours</li>\n<li>make money by selling products that use your content or data</li>\n<li>republish the content or data while charging a fee for access</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://opendefinition.org\">open definition</a>, there are only two kinds of restrictions that an open licence can place:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>that reusers must give <strong>attribution</strong> to the source of the content or data</li>\n<li>that reusers must publish any derived content or data under the same licence (this is called <strong>share-alike</strong>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An open licence might do neither or one or both of these, and you can choose which open licence to use when you publish open content or data. So, you can choose to make your content or data available under one of three levels of licence:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>a <strong>public domain</strong> licence has no restrictions at all (technically, these indicate that you waive your rights to the content or data)</li>\n<li>an <strong>attribution</strong> licence just says that reusers must give attribution to you</li>\n<li>an <strong>attribution & share-alike</strong> licence says that reusers must give attribution and share any derived content or data under the same licence</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"whatopenlicencesarethere\">What open licences are there?</h2>\n<p>There are two sets of open licences. You should use a licence from one of these sets rather than creating your own licence, for three reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>it's less work</li>\n<li>it ensures that the legal language in the licence is correct</li>\n<li>it makes it a lot easier for reusers to know what they can do with your data</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"openlicencesforcreativecontent\">Open licences for creative content</h3>\n<p>Creative content, such as text, photographs, slides and so on, should be licensed using a <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/\">Creative Commons Licence</a>. There are three of these that you should consider using for open content:</p>\n<table class=\"table\"><thead><tr><th>Level of Licence</th><th>Creative Commons Licence</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>public domain</td><td><a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0\">CC0</a></td></tr><tr><td>attribution</td><td><a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC-by</a></td></tr><tr><td>attribution & share-alike</td><td><a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC-by-sa</a></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Make sure that you use the latest (version 4.0) Creative Commons licences, which are international. The links in the table above go to the correct licences.</p>\n<p>There are other types of Creative Commons licences that are not open licences.

It is unusual for organisations to place content or data in the public domain as being given attribution for the content or data usually helps to achieve some of the goals of opening it up.</p>\n<p>It is possible to license content or data under more than one licence, and let reusers choose which licence to use it under. Typically you would <strong>dual-license</strong> some content or data by making it available under an open licence <em>and</em> under a paid-for licence that does not have the same restrictions. Dual-licensing is typically used with a share-alike licence, as outlined below.</p>\n<p>Some open data business models work best with a share-alike licence. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a share-alike licence will usually be unattractive to commercial businesses who don't want to open up their own data, so using a share-alike licence coupled with a charged licence can be a good basis for a freemium business model</li>\n<li>when you are collaborating with others to create a shared resource, a share-alike licence can help to ensure that you can bring back into that resource any work that others do on their own copies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the other hand, if you are hoping to gain other benefits for your business through the reuse of your data, using a cross-subsidy business model, you may find that a share-alike licence prevents people from reusing it, and therefore want to avoid having a share-alike restriction.</p>\n<p>There are two cases where you have no choice over what licence you can use for the content or data that you publish.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you are publishing content or data that is derived from content or data that was licenced to you using a share-alike licence, then you must publish your content or data using that same licence.</li>\n<li>With very few exceptions, if you are a government department or arms-length body then the content or data that you have created or gathered is owned by the Crown. Unless you have an exemption, granted by the <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/about/\">Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI)</a>, you must publish this data using the <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/\">Open Government Licence</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"whatattributionshouldiaskfor\">What attribution should I ask for?</h2>\n<p>If you choose a licence that includes a requirement for attribution, you need to specify what that attribution should look like.</p>\n<p>In choosing what attribution to ask for, you should consider the ways in which your data or content might be reused, and the fact that it might be combined with other data or content that might require its own attribution. If you want to encourage the reuse of your data or content, you need to make it easy for reusers to satisfy your attribution requirements.</p>\n<p>There are two things you should document:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>What should the attribution include?</strong> You will usually want the name of your organisation, and a link to either your organisation's home page or a page about the data or content you are licensing. Keep this as minimal as possible.</li>\n<li><strong>Where and how should the attribution be presented?</strong> Some attribution requirements specify that the attribution must be presented directly wherever the data is used, and may even specify the size or format of the attribution. These requirements can be difficult to adhere to, particularly for mobile application developers who have limited screen space to include such attributions. Allowing reusers to provide attribution on a separate page makes this easier.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that under the terms of the licences listed above, when a reuser uses your data or content to add value to or to create new data or content, they cannot relicense your work. Any onward reusers are bound by the same attribution requirements as the direct reusers of your content or data. It's a good idea to explicitly document this requirement because it might not be obvious to reusers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoiindicatethelicenceofcontentordata\">How do I indicate the licence of content or data?</h2>\n<p>You should indicate the licence for content or data you make available using both a human-readable description and computer-readable metadata. The clearer you make it which licence applies to your content or data, the easier it is for reusers to know that they can reuse the content or data you are licensing.</p>\n<p>The human-readable descriptions and marks that you should use are spelled out on the Creative Commons and Open Data Commons websites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/choose/\">Creative Commons licence chooser</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/\">Open Data Commons licences</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is best to embed information about the licence that some content or data is available under directly within the content or data. This ensures that the licensing information is carried around with the content or data.</p>\n<p>In addition to human-readable text, you should provide computer-readable metadata. The separate <a href=\"http://theodi.org/guides/publishers-guide-to-the-open-data-rights-statement-vocabulary\">Publisher's Guide to the Open Data Rights Stbatement Vocabulary</a> describes how to do this.</p>\n<p>If you add your dataset to a catalog, such as <a href=\"http://data.gov.uk/\">data.gov.uk</a> or the <a href=\"http://datahub.io/\">Data Hub</a>, you should make sure that you indicate the licence under which the dataset is available within that catalog. This gives people searching the catalog a quick and easy way of seeing that they will be able to reuse the dataset.</p>\n<h2 id=\"furtherreading\">Further reading</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://opendatacommons.org/faq/licenses/\">Open data commons licensing FAQ</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h2>\n<p>Very many thanks to <a href=\"http://www.francisdavey.co.uk/\">Francis Davey</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ldodds.com/\">Leigh Dodds</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.ouseful.info/\">Tony Hirst</a>, and the anonymous commenters who contributed comments on this draft.</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/publishers-guide-to-the-open-data-rights-statement-vocabulary.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/guides/publishers-guide-to-the-open-data-rights-statement-vocabulary","slug":"publishers-guide-to-the-open-data-rights-statement-vocabulary","title":"Publisher's Guide to the Open Data Rights Statement Vocabulary","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:58:24+00:00","created_at":"2013-12-03T18:13:20+00:00","tag_ids":["guide","guide","open-data","publishing"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/guide.json","web_url":null,"title":"Guide","details":{"description":"Guide","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=guide","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/guide","slug":"guide"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/guide.json","web_url":null,"title":"Guide","details":{"description":"Guide","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=guide","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/guide","slug":"guide"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/open-data.json","web_url":null,"title":"open data","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=open-data","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/open-data","slug":"open-data"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/publishing.json","web_url":null,"title":"publishing","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=publishing","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/publishing","slug":"publishing"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"This guide illustrates how to publish machine-readable rights statements using the [Open Data Rights Statement vocabulary](http://schema.theodi.org/odrs/) (ODRS). \r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"","url":"","content":"<p>This guide illustrates how to publish machine-readable rights statements using the <a href=\"http://schema.theodi.org/odrs/\">Open Data Rights Statement vocabulary</a> (ODRS). </p>\n<p>Data published to the web should always be accompanied by machine-readable metadata that describes the dataset, its means of creation and, importantly, a statement of the rights that relate to potential re-use of the data. A clear statement of rights can ensure that data re-users fully understand the potential for re-use of a dataset, whether it is suitable for their purposes, and any obligations that may incur through using the data.</p>\n<p>This guide provides an introduction to the ODRS vocabulary, and includes a number of worked examples that illustrate how to use the vocabulary to publish rights metadata in a number of different ways.</p>\n<p>A separate companion document, the <a href=\"http://theodi.org/guides/odrs-reusers-guide\">Re-users Guide to the Open Data Rights Statement Vocabulary</a>, offers some additional advice on how to process and use rights statements within applications.</p>\n<h2 id=\"overviewoftheodrsvocabulary\">Overview of the ODRS Vocabulary</h2>\n<p>The ODRS vocabularly is based around describing the relationships between three types of resource: <em>Datasets</em>, <em>Rights Statements</em> and <em>Licences</em>. Each of these are introduced in the following sections.</p>\n<h3 id=\"datasets\">Datasets</h3>\n<p>There are many different definitions of the term \"dataset\": different communities define the term very differently. The ODRS vocabulary deliberates avoids adopting a single definition in order to allow it to be used in a number of different ways.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of this document, the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#class-dataset\">Data Catalog Vocabulary</a> (DCAT) provides a useful working <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#class-dataset\">definition of a dataset</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A collection of data, published or curated by a single source, and available for access or download in one or more formats.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One intended use of the ODRS vocabulary is to provide a more detailed description of the rights associated with a Dataset described using the DCAT vocabulary, as well as other Linked Data vocabularies such as <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/void/\">VoiD</a>. However it can also be used to help describe datasets published in other ways, as well as data exposed via web APIs.</p>\n<p>As a data publisher you should ensure that all of your datasets are associated with rights information to ensure re-users can be clear on how the data can be used. Clearly labelled rights are an important part of sustainable Open Data publishing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"licences\">Licences</h3>\n<p>A <em>Dataset</em> is usually associated with a <em>Licence</em>. The ODRS vocabulary uses a broad definition of licence which is intended to cover any legal document which describes the re-use rights that apply to some information, including a complete waiver of rights (e.g. a public domain dedication).</p>\n<p>The ODRS vocabulary does not provide a machine-readable description of licensing terms. The <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns\">Creative Commons vocabulary</a> (ccRel) already provides the terms required for describing the broad classes of permissions, requirements and prohibitions that are commonly described in legal licences.</p>\n<p>As a data publisher, if you are not using a standard licence, such as the <a href=\"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/\">Open Database License</a> then you are encouraged to publish additional machine-readable data about your licence, using the ccRel vocabulary. A worked example of this is shown later in the document.</p>\n<p>Rather than describing licences, the ODRS vocabularly instead focuses on describing <em>Rights Statements</em>. A Rights Statement is the application of a a <em>Licence</em> to a <em>Dataset</em>.</p>\n<p>In some juristictions, particularly the EU, a dataset might actually have several licences associated with it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Dataset Licence, e.g. the Open Database Licence, that covers re-use of the dataset</li>\n<li>A Content Licence, e.g. the Open Database Content Licence, that covers re-use of the contents of a dataset</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"rightsstatements\">Rights Statements</h3>\n<p>A <em>Rights Statement</em> is a resource that describes the relationship between a <em>Dataset</em> and its <em>Licence(s)</em>. It is also used to describe additional contextual information that applies to the re-use of a dataset. </p>\n<p>For example a statement of rights may typically include some or all of the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A reference to a Dataset Licence</li>\n<li>A reference to a Content Licence (if, and where applicable)</li>\n<li>Copyright notices, that should be referenced or displayed by re-users</li>\n<li>Guidance on a means of attributing the source of the data, e.g. when re-used in an application</li>\n<li>Pointers to further information, e.g. further guidance on re-use or details on how to acquire additional rights</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The description of a Licence, such as the <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/\">UK Open Government Licence</a>, remains unchanged no matter how it is used by an organisation when publishing data. It is the Rights Statement that captures the context of the use of a licence to support the publication of a dataset, including descriptions of relevant notices, attribution guidance and other relevant relationships.</p>\n<p>A Rights Statement might apply to an individual Dataset. But it could equally be applied to several Datasets. If your organization publishes data under a consistent set of rights, then you need only publish a single machine-readable rights statement which can then be associated with all of your datasets. However if rights vary across datasets, then each dataset should have its own rights statement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"attributionrequirementsattributionversuscitation\">Attribution Requirements: Attribution versus Citation</h3>\n<p>Publishers often want to be acknowledged for the effort involved in producing and publishing Open Data. Data re-users often need to refer to their data sources. There are two related, but relatively distinct use cases where these needs are important:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Attribution</em> -- giving credit to the creator and/or maintainer of a dataset</li>\n<li><em>Citation</em> -- linking to a source dataset that has been used in some analysis, or the components of an aggregated dataset</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many licences allow publishers to require attribution when a dataset is re-used, but it can be unclear how this should be achieved. Norms for dataset citation also vary. E.g. the research community have well-defined conventions for citing datasets in research papers that describe some research or analysis.</p>\n<p>Citation usually involves clearly identifying the specific dataset, or version of a dataset, that has been used. Citation helps to identify the provenance of data, allowing others to potentially recreate some analysis or discover interesting datasets. The citation use case is already well supported by existing dataset metadata vocabularies. A citation typically includes a link or reference to a dataset that includes its title, versioning information (including publication dates), the dataset homepage, and perhaps download locations for specific distribtions. Vocabularies like DCAT and Dublin Core already support publication of this type of metadata.</p>\n<p>Attribution is typically less formal. The goal is usually to acknowledge the dataset creator by name, often with a link to either the dataset homepage or a specific attribution or acknowledgement page. </p>\n<p>The ODRS vocabulary provides two terms to support publishing in describing means of attribution:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>attributionText</code> -- the text to be used when attributing the creator of some data. Typically this will just be the name of your organization, e.g. your company or government department. However it might also be a more general phrase. E.g. a crowd-sourced dataset might use <code>attributionText</code> of: \"<em>Wikipedia Community</em>\". You can use this property to specify the attribution text you would like data re-users to use. Without this, re-users will need to decide for themselves how to reference your organisation or dataset. The re-users guide includes some guidance on this.</li>\n<li><code>attributionURL</code> -- this is the URL to be used when building an attribution link. The expectation is that the link text displayed to a user will be the value of the <code>attributionText</code> property. As a data publisher this provides you with the ability to request attribution to a specific web page. While this might be the dataset homepage, or a link to your organization homepage, it may also be a link to a dedicated attribution page. This is particularly useful if you must also acknowledge your data sources. The ability to provide a specific destination page for attribution links also makes it easier to avoid \"attribution stacking\" issues which can make attribution and re-use difficult.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Publishers should keep attribution text as short as possible, recognising that their data may get re-used in a wide variety of locations. The following are all good examples of attribution text:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>My Organization</em></li>\n<li><em>Open Data, Ltd</em></li>\n<li><em>Crowd sourced data community</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following examples are problematic:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Data sourced from My Organization dataset</em></li>\n<li><em>Contains data provided by My Organization. Copyright 2013.</em></li>\n<li><em>This data covers records processed by MyOrg in the period XYZ to XYZ. Data is covered by Crown Copyright</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These examples remove any flexibility on behalf of the data re-user to format and structure links to your dataset in a manner that is in-line with their application. For example the text is either lengthy, difficult to link, or mixes together attribution text with copyright statements (see below). </p>\n<p>The ODRS vocabulary deliberately doesn't describe how to format attributions or citations, e.g. on a web page. Data might be consumed in a number of different ways and displayed on a number of different devices (if at all). Publishers should recognise that styles of attribution and citation will vary between communities and be flexible on their expectations for how this information is displayed. A scientific researcher citing some data in an academic paper will follow (and be bound by) different styles of attribution and citation than a web developer building a mobile application.</p>\n<p>The goal of the ODRS vocabulary, and for machine-readable dataset metadata in general, is to ensure that the data required to support these various use cases is easily accessible to re-users without the need to read detailed attribution guidelines.</p>\n<h3 id=\"publishingcopyrightnotices\">Publishing Copyright Notices</h3>\n<p>Copyright notices are another important item of metadata that might usefully be added to a rights statement. Some open licenses, particularly those from the Creative Commons state that re-users should display any copyright notices provided by publishers.</p>\n<p>If you hold copyright over some part of your dataset, you may wish to publish a copyright notice for re-users. This can be useful as it will support re-users in displaying or referencing a copyright notice or preserving a notice when redistributing data, if this is allowed by your data license.</p>\n<p>The ODRS vocabulary includes two terms for capturing copyright notice information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>copyrightNotice</code> -- this property allows a data publisher to specify a short copyright notice that can be used directly.</li>\n<li><code>copyrightStatement</code> -- this property allows you specify a URL for the copyright statement. This can be used an alternative to <code>copyrightNotice</code>, instead providing a link to a web page that describes the copyright status of the dataset and any relevant notices. A re-user would link to this page, rather than including your copyright notice. This can be useful if your copyright notices are lengthy, e.g. if you have to reference several sources.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a general guide you should keep your copyright notices short and the text should be distinct from your <code>attributionText</code>. Wikipedia includes some notes on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_notice#Technical_requirements\">technical requirements for copyright notices</a> and there is generally specific advice available from your national copyright agency. See for example <a href=\"http://www.copyrightservice.co.uk/copyright/p03_copyright_notices\">guidance from the UK Copyright Service</a> and <a href=\"http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.pdf\">the US Copyright Office</a>.</p>\n<p>Generally, unless there is specific guidance that applies to your organisation or region, then it is recommended that a copyright notice consist of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The phrase \"<em>Copyright</em>\"</li>\n<li>The copyright symbol</li>\n<li>The year of copyright</li>\n<li>The copyright owners name, or a well-known alias</li>\n</ul>\n<p>E.g. \"<em>Copyright © 2013. Example, Ltd</em>\".</p>\n<p>The copyright owners name may overlap with the attribution text, but may also be different. The attribution text should not contain a copyright symbol or the word \"Copyright\" and instead be the name of the organisation or group who should be attributed. Separately and clearly marking up these different elements will provide more flexibility for re-users.</p>\n<p>For example an <code>attributionText</code> of <em>Dept of Data</em> and <em>© Crown copyright 2013</em> could be combined in several ways, e.g.:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To create a phrase to be added in a web page footer: <em>Uses data from Dept. of Data. © Crown copyright 2013</em></li>\n<li>To build an attribution link for a data element on a page (<em>Data from Dept. of Data</em>), whilst the copyright statement is referenced in the footer of the page (<em>© Crown copyright 2013. Dept of Data</em>)</li>\n<li>The developer could create a simplified attribution statement that combined attribution text and copyright notices from multiple sources, e.g. <em>Uses data from Dept. of Data and Ministry of Facts. © Crown copyright 2013</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"usingtheodrsvocabulary\">Using the ODRS Vocabulary</h2>\n<p>The ODRS vocabulary is intended to be used to publish machine-readable metadata in a variety of formats. The vocabulary has been formally defined using RDFS and OWL, allowing it to be directly used as a means of publishing Linked Data and RDFa. However the vocabulary can also be viewed as a simple conceptual framework that can be used to guide the publication of data in other ways, e.g in simple JSON or XML formats.</p>\n<p>The following sections provide details on using the vocabulary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to publish Rights Statements as embedded metadata in web pages using RDFa</li>\n<li>to publish Rights Statements as Linked Data, using formats like Turtle and JSON-LD</li>\n<li>how to add links to rights statements to web APIs and existing formats</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The examples in the first section on RDFa introduces the core terms in the vocabulary, while the later examples focus on details of specific data formats.</p>\n<p>The github project that supports this vocabulary includes some <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/open-data-licensing/tree/master/examples\">additional standalone examples</a> that can be used a further reference.</p>\n<h3 id=\"publishingrightsstatementsinwebpagesusingrdfa\">Publishing Rights Statements in Web Pages using RDFa</h3>\n<p>ODRS metadata can easily be embedded into a web page using <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/\">RDFa</a>. This makes it easy to enhance your dataset and API documentation with some machine-readable metadata.</p>\n<p>The following sections show how to markup a rights statement using RDFa. Each example highlights a specific aspect of the vocabulary and is present as a simple HTML fragment. To be valid RDFa some prefixes must be declared in the document. Each of the examples can be added to the following page template to make a valid document:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;html prefix=\"dct: http://purl.org/dc/terms/\n              rdf: http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\n              dcat: http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#\n     odrs: http://schema.theodi.org/odrs#\"&gt;\n\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;!-- Example HTML+RDFa Fragment --&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The complete set of example files can be found in <a href=\"(https://github.com/theodi/open-data-licensing/blob/master/examples/\">the example section</a> of the supporting github project.</p>\n<h4 id=\"markinguparightsstatementwithasinglelicense\">Marking up a Rights Statement with a single license</h4>\n<p>A machine-readable description of a dataset can be published using the DCAT vocabulary. The following HTML fragment shows a very simple description of a dataset published as RDFa:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;div typeof=\"dcat:Dataset\" resource=\"http://gov.example.org/dataset/example\"&gt;\n        &lt;h1 property=\"dct:title\"&gt;Example Dataset&lt;/h1&gt;                      \n\n        &lt;div property=\"dct:license\" \n             resource=\"http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence\"&gt;\n            &lt;a href=\"http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence\"&gt;\n                UK Open Government Licence (OGL)\n            &lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;!-- additional markup with further description of dataset --&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt; \n</code></pre>\n<p>The outer <code>div</code> element identifies the dataset being described and assigns it a type of <code>dcat:Dataset</code>. The other nested elements define the title (<code>dct:title</code>) and license (<code>dct:license</code>) of the dataset. </p>\n<p>The <code>dct:license</code> property is already in relatively common use for associating a resource with its license, and it is recommended that publishers continue to use the property to ensure compatibility with existing applications. But using the ODRS vocabulary we can provide a richer description of the rights associated with a dataset.</p>\n<p>The following HTML fragment illustrates the most basic use of the ODRS vocabulary. </p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;div typeof=\"dcat:Dataset\" resource=\"http://gov.example.org/dataset/example\"&gt;\n        &lt;h1 property=\"dct:title\"&gt;Example Dataset&lt;/h1&gt;                      \n\n        &lt;div property=\"dct:rights\" resource=\"#rights\" typeof=\"odrs:RightsStatement\"&gt;\n            &lt;h2 property=\"rdfs:label\"&gt;Rights Statement&lt;/h2&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;Published under the \n                &lt;a href=\"http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence\" \n                    property=\"odrs:dataLicense\"&gt;UK Open Government Licence (OGL)\n                &lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;p&gt;If you would like to attribute your use of this dataset, \n                please use a link similar to the following: \n                &lt;a href=\"http://gov.example.org/dataset/example\" \n                    property=\"odrs:attributionURL\"&gt;\n                    &lt;span property=\"odrs:attributionText\"&gt;\n                        Example Department\n                    &lt;/span&gt;\n                &lt;/a&gt;.\n            &lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div property=\"dct:license\" \n             resource=\"http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence\"&gt;\n            &lt;a href=\"http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence\"&gt;\n                UK Open Government Licence (OGL)\n            &lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;!-- additional markup with further description of dataset --&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;  \n</code></pre>\n<p>The description of the dataset has been enhanced to include a rights statement resource. The rights statement is associated with the dataset using the Dublin Core <code>dct:rights</code> relationship. The rights statement resource has a type of <code>odrs:RightsStatement</code> and has been described usings several properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An <code>rdfs:label</code> which provides a human-readable label for the rights. This could also be supplemented with, e.g. a <code>dct:description</code> property to provide an additional summary of the rights</li>\n<li>An <code>odrs:dataLicense</code> property which specifies the licence covers the re-use of the data. This property should be consistent with the <code>dct:license</code> property where both are provided. </li>\n<li>The <code>odrs:attributionText</code> and <code>odrs:attributionURL</code> properties indicate how to attribute the dataset</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"markinguparightsstatementwithmultiplelicenses\">Marking up a Rights Statement with multiple licenses</h4>\n<p>In some circumstances there are different rights that relate to a dataset (or database) as a whole, and the contents of that database. The ODRS vocabulary allows multiple licences to be associated with a dataset, allowing these data and content licenses to be clearly defined.</p>\n<p>The following example dataset includes a Rights Statement that has both the <code>odrs:dataLicense</code> and <code>odrs:contentLicense</code> properties. </p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;div typeof=\"dcat:Dataset\" resource=\"http://gov.example.org/dataset/example\"&gt;\n        &lt;h1 property=\"dct:title\"&gt;Example Dataset&lt;/h1&gt;                      \n\n        &lt;div property=\"dct:rights\" resource=\"#rights\" typeof=\"odrs:RightsStatement\"&gt;\n            &lt;h2 property=\"rdfs:label\"&gt;Rights Statement&lt;/h2&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;This dataset may be re-used according to the following licenses:&lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;ul&gt;\n                &lt;li&gt;Data Licence: \n                    &lt;a href=\"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/\"&gt;\n                        property=\"odrs:dataLicense\"&gt;Open Database License&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n                &lt;li&gt;Content Licence: \n                    &lt;a href=\"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/dbcl/1.0/\" \n                        property=\"odrs:contentLicense\"&gt;Open Database Content License&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n            &lt;p&gt;If you would like to attribute your use of this dataset, \n                please use a link similar to the following: \n                &lt;a href=\"http://gov.example.org/dataset/example\" \n                    property=\"odrs:attributionURL\"&gt;\n                    &lt;span property=\"odrs:attributionText\"&gt;\n                        Example Department\n                    &lt;/span&gt;\n                &lt;/a&gt;.\n            &lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div property=\"dct:license\" \n             resource=\"http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence\"&gt;\n            &lt;a href=\"http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence\"&gt;\n                UK Open Government Licence (OGL)\n            &lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;!-- additional markup with further description of dataset --&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;        \n</code></pre>\n<p>In this example the licence properties refer to the <a href=\"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/\">Open Database Licence</a> and the <a href=\"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/dbcl/\">Open Database Content License</a>. While those licences might often be used together, an alternative licence could be applied to the copyrightable part of a dataset. For example a publisher might prefer to use a Creative Commons Licence.</p>\n<p>The ability to clearly distinguish between these different types of licences is an important part of the ODRS vocabulary. Notice that the <code>dct:license</code> property only refers to the data license. In the context of describing datasets, it is recommended that this property only ever be used to refer to a data license.</p>\n<p>Publishers should only create rights statements that include at most one data or content license. A Rights Statement should not have multiple data licences or content licenses. </p>\n<p>Some open licences can be used to license both data and content, so a single licence may cover all aspects of re-use. However it is recommended that publishers still include both of the ODRS licence properties, even if they refer to the same licence resource.</p>\n<h4 id=\"includingcopyrightnoticesanduserguidelines\">Including Copyright Notices and User Guidelines</h4>\n<p>The description of a Rights Statement can be enriched by including further metadata, including copyright notices. For example while a dataset or its contents might be licensed under a Creative Commons licence, the publisher still retains their copyright in the content. Creative Commons licences indicate that re-users should retain any notices that are provided by a publisher.</p>\n<p>The ODRS vocabulary captures copyright information separately to attribution text, making it easier for applications to extract and display the relevant information.</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;div typeof=\"dcat:Dataset\" resource=\"http://gov.example.org/dataset/example\"&gt;\n        &lt;h1 property=\"dct:title\"&gt;Example Dataset&lt;/h1&gt;                      \n\n        &lt;div property=\"dct:rights\" resource=\"#rights\" typeof=\"odrs:RightsStatement\"&gt;\n            &lt;h2 property=\"rdfs:label\"&gt;Rights Statement&lt;/h2&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;Published under the \n                &lt;a href=\"http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence\" \n                    property=\"odrs:dataLicense\"&gt;UK Open Government Licence (OGL)\n                &lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;p&gt;When re-using or distributing this data please preserve the \n               following copyright notice: \"\n                &lt;span property=\"odrs:copyrightNotice\"&gt;© Crown copyright 2013.

An application might choose to display the copyright notice differently to the attribution text, e.g. including it in a general copyright notice section of the application website or in a copyright statement document included in a re-distributed version of the dataset.</p>\n<p>In some cases it may be more suitable to provide a link to a copyright statement, e.g. if the text of the copyright notice is lengthy or subject to change. In this case the <code>odrs:copyrightStatement</code> property can be used instead.

These guidelines might be an FAQ or other user guide that provides a useful overview of the rights statement. In this example the same web page contains both user guidance and a copyright statement.</p>\n<h4 id=\"publishingstandalonerightsstatements\">Publishing Standalone Rights Statements</h4>\n<p>In the previous examples a description of a dataset and its rights statement have been marked up in a single web page. If you are publishing only a single dataset then this will likely be sufficient. If your rights statements will vary across datasets, e.g. to include different licensing, copyright or attribution details, then you should use a per-dataset rights statement.</p>\n<p>However if you are publishing several datasets under the same terms then it may be easier to publish a standard rights statement that applies to all of your datasets.</p>\n<p>For example the following HTML includes a machine-readable rights statement that might be accessible from: <code>http://gov.example.org/rights</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;div typeof=\"odrs:RightsStatement\" resource=\"http://gov.example.org/rights#rights\"&gt;\n        &lt;h1 property=\"rdfs:label\"&gt;Rights Statement for Re-use Of Our Open Data&lt;/h1&gt;                      \n\n        &lt;p&gt;All our data is published under the \n             &lt;a href=\"http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence\" \n                property=\"odrs:contentLicense\"&gt;UK Open Government Licence (OGL)&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;p&gt;If you would like to attribute your use of our data then, \n           please use a link similar to the following: \n              &lt;a href=\"http://gov.example.org/open-data\" \n                 property=\"odrs:attributionURL\"&gt;\n                   &lt;span property=\"odrs:attributionText\"&gt;Example Department&lt;/span&gt;\n              &lt;/a&gt;.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This standard rights statement could then be referenced from dataset descriptions published elsewhere on your website:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;div typeof=\"dcat:Dataset\" resource=\"http://gov.example.org/dataset/example\"&gt;\n        &lt;h1 property=\"dct:title\"&gt;Example Dataset&lt;/h1&gt;                      \n\n        &lt;p&gt;This dataset is published under an open license.

While publishers are encouraged to use an \"off-the-shelf\" license wherever possible, in the circumstances where a custom license is required then it would be useful to have a machine-readable description of the key facets of that license.</p>\n<p>The following example illustrates how to combine <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns\">the Creative Commons vocabulary</a> with ODRS:</p>\n<pre><code>:example4\n    a dcat:Dataset ;\n    dct:title \"Dataset with Custom License\" ;\n    dct:rights :example4-rights-statement ;\n    dct:license :example4-license .\n\n:example4-rights-statement\n    a odrs:RightsStatement ;\n    rdfs:label \"Rights Statement referencing our custom license\" ;\n    odrs:dataLicense :example4-license .\n\n:example4-license\n    a odrs:License, cc:License;\n    rdfs:label \"Custom Data License\";\n    cc:legalcode &lt;http://example.org/legal/custom-license&gt; ;\n    cc:permits cc:DerivativeWorks, cc:Distribtion, cc:Reproduction ;\n    cc:requires cc:Notice , cc:ShareAlike .\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above example includes a rights statement that refers to a custom licence. The licence is described using terms from the Creative Commons vocabulary including a link to its legal definition and a series of permissions and requirements. </p>\n<p>This particular licence is a variation of the CC-BY licence: it permits the creation of derivative works, distribution and reproduction of the data and the re-user must include all copyright notices and license derivatives using similar terms; but there is no <em>legal</em> requirement to include attribution.</p>\n<h3 id=\"linkingtorightsstatementsfromwebapis\">Linking to Rights Statements from Web APIs</h3>\n<p>As well as raw data downloads, datasets may also be published via a web API, allowing users to query and extract portions of the data as they need it. The data exposed via the API should also be associated with a clear rights statement. Rather than burying this information in API documentation or the terms of use of a service it can be referenced directly from the results of an API request.</p>\n<p>The simplest approach to this is to include a link from the API response to a rights statement published elsewhere, e.g. as RDFa annotations to existing API documentation. </p>\n<p>The <code>Link</code> HTTP header defined by <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988\">RFC5988</a> can be used to add links to HTTP API responses without the need to change the body of the response. This avoids the need to change existing formats and potential impacts on users.</p>\n<p>For example an HTTP GET request to the fictitious API available at <code>http://api.example.org/search</code> might return the following response:</p>\n<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nCache-Control: max-age=86400, must-revalidate\nContent-Type: application/json\nDate: Mon, 17 Jun 2013 13:45:45\nLink: &lt;http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/&gt;; rel=\"license\", \n      &lt;http://api.example.org/docs/rights&gt;; rel=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/rights\"\nServer: Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS)\nVary: Accept\nContent-Length: 12345\n\n{ ...some JSON data... }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The HTTP response includes a <code>Link</code> header that defines two links for this HTTP response. The first uses the standard <code>license</code> relation to refer to the data licence associated with the data included in the response. This relation is equivalent to the <code>dct:license</code> property used in the RDFa and Linked Data examples. Where included it should reference the data license for the API response.</p>\n<p>A custom link relation is also included in the response. This relation uses the URI of the <code>dct:rights</code> relationship as the identifier for the relationship. Its value if a link to a separate machine-readable rights statement. An application might follow this link and extract RDFa from the resulting web page to determine the licenses, attribution requirements, etc associated with the API.</p>\n<p>Link relations might also be used directly in API responses. Some standard formats define extensible link elements that could also be used to reference a rights statement. For example an Atom based API might include <code>atom:link</code> elements to reference a rights statement.</p>\n<p>It is increasingly common for Web APIs to be based on JSON. The following section looks in more detail at publishing rights statements in JSON formats.</p>\n<h3 id=\"publishingrightsstatementsinjson\">Publishing Rights Statements in JSON</h3>\n<p>The following example shows a simple JSON object that describes a simple, standalone rights statement. </p>\n<pre><code>    {\n        \"contentLicense\": \"http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence\",\n        \"dataLicense\": \"http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence\",\n        \"copyrightNotice\": \"© Crown copyright 2013\",\n        \"attributionText\": \"Example Department\",\n        \"attributionURL\": \"http://gov.example.org/dataset/example\"\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>This structure uses a trivial encoding of the ODRS vocabulary into JSON, with the object having keys that directly correspond to the properties defined by the ODRS vocabulary. </p>\n<p>To include a rights statement in a document that also, for example, describes a dataset, use a <code>rights</code> key as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>    {\n        \"title\": \"Example Dataset\",\n        \"license\": \"http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence\",\n        \"rights\": {\n            \"contentLicense\": \"http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence\",\n            \"dataLicense\": \"http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence\",\n            \"copyrightNotice\": \"© Crown copyright 2013\",\n            \"attributionText\": \"Example Department\",\n            \"attributionURL\": \"http://gov.example.org/dataset/example\"\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"interpretingajsonrightsstatementasjsonldandrdf\">Interpreting a JSON Rights Statement as JSON-LD and RDF</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://json-ld.org/\">JSON-LD</a> is a light-weight data format for publishing Linked Data as JSON. </p>\n<p>JSON-LD documents can be processed as JSON but also have a standard mapping to RDF. In addition to defining some conventions for encoding data in JSON documents, JSON-LD also defines a way to <a href=\"http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/#interpreting-json-as-json-ld\">allow simple JSON to be interpreted as JSON-LD</a> and hence as RDF. This is achieved by interpreting the data using a JSON-LD context.</p>\n<p>A JSON-LD context can be referenced from an HTTP <code>Link</code> header, allowing applications that wish to process the data as JSON-LD or as RDF to easily convert the data. For example a GET request to a standalone JSON document containing a rights statement could reference a JSON-LD context as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nCache-Control: max-age=86400, must-revalidate\nContent-Type: application/json\nDate: Mon, 17 Jun 2013 13:45:45\nLink: &lt;http://schema.theodi.org/odrs/odrs-jsonld.json&gt;; \n        rel=\"http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context\"; type=\"application/ld+json\"\nServer: Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS)\nContent-Length: 12345\n\n{ ...the rights statement as JSON... }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The JSON-LD context available from <code>http://schema.theodi.org/odrs/odrs-jsonld.json</code> defines how JSON key-value pairs should be interpreted and mapped to the ODRS vocabulary. The complete JSON-LD context for the ODRS vocabulary is included below:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n    \"@context\": {\n        \"RightsStatement\": \"http://schema.theodi.org/odrs#RightsStatement\",\n        \"License\": \"http://schema.theodi.org/odrs#License\",\n        \"rights\": {\n            \"@id\": \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/rights\",\n            \"@type\": \"@id\"\n        },\n        \"license\": {\n            \"@id\": \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/license\",\n            \"@type\": \"@id\"\n        },\n        \"dataLicense\": {\n            \"@id\": \"http://schema.theodi.org/odrs#dataLicense\",\n            \"@type\": \"@id\"\n        },\n        \"contentLicense\": {\n            \"@id\": \"http://schema.theodi.org/odrs#contentLicense\",\n            \"@type\": \"@id\"\n        },\n        \"reuserGuidelines\": {\n            \"@id\": \"http://schema.theodi.org/odrs#reuserGuidelines\",\n            \"@type\": \"@id\"\n        },\n        \"attributionURL\": {\n            \"@id\": \"http://schema.theodi.org/odrs#attributionURL\",\n            \"@type\": \"@id\"\n        },\n        \"copyrightStatement\": {\n            \"@id\": \"http://schema.theodi.org/odrs#copyrightStatement\",\n            \"@type\": \"@id\"\n        },\n        \"copyrightNotice\": \"http://schema.theodi.org/odrs#copyrightNotice\",\n        \"attributionText\": \"http://schema.theodi.org/odrs#attributionText\"\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>While this context is suitable for use with simple standalone rights statements, if your JSON documents include additional data, e.g. a dataset description, then you may need to include this context alongside your own definitions.</p>\n<h4 id=\"publishingrightsstatementsdirectlyasjsonld\">Publishing Rights Statements directly as JSON-LD</h4>\n<p>The following final example shows a single JSON-LD document that contains a description of a dataset and its associated rights statement. The example illustrates how to publish a rights statement directly as a JSON-LD document. In this instance the <code>@context</code> is simply used to declare some prefixes for properties used elsewhere in the document:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n    \"@context\": {\n        \"dcat\": \"http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#\",\n        \"dct\": \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\",\n        \"odrs\": \"http://schema.theodi.org/odrs#\",\n        \"rdf\": \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\"\n    },\n    \"@id\": \"http://gov.example.org/dataset/example\",\n    \"@type\": \"dcat:Dataset\",\n    \"dct:title\": \"Example Dataset\",\n    \"dct:license\": {\n        \"@id\": \"http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence\",\n        \"dct:title\": \"UK Open Government Licence (OGL)\"\n    },\n    \"dct:rights\": {\n        \"rdfs:label\": \"Rights Statement\",\n        \"@id\": \"http://gov.example.org/dataset/example#rights\",\n        \"odrs:copyrightNotice\": \"© Crown copyright 2013\",\n        \"odrs:attributionText\": \"Example Department\",\n        \"odrs:attributionURL\": {\n            \"@id\": \"http://gov.example.org/dataset/example\"\n        },\n        \"odrs:contentLicense\": {\n            \"@id\": \"http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence\"\n        },\n        \"odrs:dataLicense\": {\n            \"@id\": \"http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Leigh Dodds","slug":"leigh-dodds","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/leigh-dodds","tag_ids":["team","rnd-programme","staff"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Leigh Dodds","slug":"leigh-dodds","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/leigh-dodds","tag_ids":["team","rnd-programme","staff"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/reusers-guide-open-data-licensing.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/guides/reusers-guide-open-data-licensing","slug":"reusers-guide-open-data-licensing","title":"Reuser's Guide to Open Data Licensing","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:53:27+00:00","created_at":"2013-05-01T11:59:24+00:00","tag_ids":["guide"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/guide.json","web_url":null,"title":"Guide","details":{"description":"Guide","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=guide","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/guide","slug":"guide"}}],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"The fact that you can get hold of some information does not necessarily mean that you can do whatever you want with it.

You need to have permission from the owner of that information to do what you want to do. A <strong>licence</strong> tells you what you can do.</p>\n<p>But what does it mean to license data? What requirements can a licence place on you? What different licences to publishers use? How can you find out what licence a dataset is available under? This guide answers these questions.</p>\n<p><em>Note: This guide focuses on data published by organisations based in the UK. Licensing law is different in different countries, so some of this information might not apply to you if you are reusing information that is published elsewhere. It does not address other potential legal considerations, such as compliance with the Data Protection Act.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"whatislicensing\">What Is Licensing?</h2>\n<p>When someone puts care and thought into creating something, such as writing a blog post or taking a photograph, they own that work. This means they have the right to determine how it gets used.</p>\n<p>If you want to use the content or data, you have to either establish that they no longer have the rights to that work (because they have waived them), or ask their permission to use it. <strong>Licences</strong> are how they explicitly give you permission to use their work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatdopublishersown\">What Do Publishers Own?</h3>\n<p>In Europe, there are two kinds of rights that publishers — organisations or individuals who make available content or data — are given over things that they have created:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>they get <strong><a href=\"http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/copy.htm\">copyright</a></strong> over works (<strong>content</strong>) that they create and which are original to them, such as text that they write or photographs they take</li>\n<li>they get a <strong><a href=\"http://www.ipo.gov.uk/c-databaseright.htm\">database right</a></strong> over collections of <strong>data</strong> that they have put a substantial effort into obtaining, verifying or presenting</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note: As far as we know the database right is unique to the European Union. In some countries there may be no protection for collections of data.</em></p>\n<p>If someone applies original judgement in putting together a database, for example in choosing which items to include within the database or which information about them to include, they have a copyright over that database, because it is a creative work.</p>\n<p>For example, if someone were to build a database about the best 100 cars, this might involve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>choosing which cars count as the best cars</li>\n<li>writing a description about each car</li>\n<li>researching and gathering facts about them</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They would have copyright over the database, because they chose which cars were \"best\". They would have copyright over the descriptions, because they wrote them. And they would probably have the database right for the database they've built, because they put substantial effort into gathering information about the cars. Importantly, they don't own the facts about the cars — you or anyone else could build your own database containing exactly those facts without violating their database right — but no one else can reuse their database or their descriptions without their permission because they own the copyright over them.</p>\n<p>Publishers probably do not have a database right if they <em>create</em> the facts in a database, as opposed to gathering them from elsewhere, unless they put substantial effort into verifying or presenting the database. For example, if someone owns a restaurant and creates a database of the dishes that they offer, and when they offer them, they probably do not have a database right over that database, though they might have copyright because of the creative judgement involved in working out which dishes should be offered on particular days to provide a balanced menu.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whataboutdatafromthirdparties\">What About Data From Third Parties?</h3>\n<p>Publishers might not own all the content or data that they publish themselves. In particular, rather than creating the content or gathering the data themselves, some of the content and data they publish might be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>completely licensed by them from someone else</li>\n<li>include an extract of content or data that they have licensed from someone else</li>\n<li>be derived from the content or data that they have licensed from someone else</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When they publish the data, the publisher should tell you about which content or data is owned by another organisation, and under which licence it is being republished.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whataboutbrands\">What About Brands?</h3>\n<p>Brands are usually protected through a <a href=\"http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm/t-about/t-whatis.htm\">trade mark</a>. A trade mark restricts how you can use an organisation's logo or company name. They will also have copyright on the logo.</p>\n<p>Licences for content or data usually explicitly exclude logos and company names, so you cannot, for example, adapt a logo by changing the colours used within it. You also cannot use the company name or logo to lend weight to your product without permission to do so. However, the <a href=\"#attribution\">attribution requirements</a> of a licence may require you to use the company name and logo to indicate that you have reused data owned by that company.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatcantyoudo\">What Can't You Do?</h2>\n<p>There are a few things that you can do with content or data without a licence, but in general you need to be given a licence by a publisher if you want to reuse their content or data. Having access to some content or data — for example by downloading it from a publisher's website — does not give you the right to reuse it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"republishingandaddingvalue\">Republishing and Adding Value</h3>\n<p>You do not automatically have the right to republish, in its entirety, content or data that someone else owns, even if they have given you a licence to use it yourself. You need to check the terms of the licence for the content or data to make sure that you can republish it.</p>\n<p>The same applies if you are adding value to the content or data, for example by automatically adding links or styling to content, or adding columns with extra information into a dataset. The new content or data includes the entirety of someone else's content or data, so you cannot publish it unless you have their permission.</p>\n<h3 id=\"publishingextracts\">Publishing Extracts</h3>\n<p>You have the right to publish extracts of content or databases that you have access to, regardless of what the licence says, so long as the extract is not \"substantial\". However, it is often hard to tell if the extract that you have made is \"substantial\".</p>\n<p>The licence that you have been given might let you republish any amount of the content or data (open licences do this). Otherwise, you should take legal advice about whether the extracts that you want to publish are likely to count as substantial or not.</p>\n<h3 id=\"publishingderivedcontentordata\">Publishing Derived Content or Data</h3>\n<p>You might want to create new content or databases by adapting, deriving, or otherwise processing some content or data. To do that, you first have to ensure you have been given a licence to use the data in the first place. You then need to look at what the licence says about creating derived works.</p>\n<p>For example, say you have been given a licence to use a photograph on your website. You could create a new version of that photograph by changing it from colour to black &amp; white, or by adding a speech bubble to it.</p>\n<p>In this case, the photograph is a creative work, and the person who took it owns the copyright. Because the photograph is protected by copyright, you can only create these new images if the licence under which you are using the photograph allows you to do so.</p>\n<p>Copyright can exist in small pieces of content, such as phrases. For example, if you analyse some content to create a new database, you should make sure that you have the right to reuse any snippets of content that you might keep in the new database. If the content includes a presentation of data from a database, you have to consider database rights as well: scraping data from the page might equate to creating an extract.</p>\n<p>Database rights are slightly different, because they only extend to creating extracts or re-utilising (republishing) a database.</p>\n<p>For example, say you analysed the data about prescriptions of each drug within each GP practice within the UK, along with other data about the coverage of each practice, to create a new dataset that provided the average spend per patient of each practice. So long as you had no separate contractual obligations to the owners of the two datasets you have brought together, you might well be free to do what you liked with the result, as it would not be possible to reconstruct the original databases from the aggregated data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdolicencessay\">What Do Licences Say?</h2>\n<p>Licences tell you what you <em>can</em> do with the content or data that you access. A licence will tell you whether you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>republish the content or data on your own website</li>\n<li>derive new content or data from it</li>\n<li>make money by selling products that use it</li>\n<li>republish it while charging a fee for access</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many licences will let you access content or data for free, but say that you cannot republish it or adapt it, or use it within commercial products. If you break the terms of the licence, the owner of the content or data can take you to court.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoopenlicencessay\">What Do Open Licences Say?</h2>\n<p>An <strong>open licence</strong> is one that places very few restrictions on what you can do with the content or data that is being licensed.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://opendefinition.org\">Open Definition</a>, There are only two kinds of restrictions that an open licence can place:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>that you must give <strong>attribution</strong> to the source of the content or data</li>\n<li>that you must publish any derived content or data under the same licence (this is called <strong>share-alike</strong>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An open licence might do neither or one or both of these. So, you might encounter content or data available under one of three levels of licence:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>a <strong>public domain</strong> licence has no restrictions at all (technically, these indicate that the rights owner has waived their rights to the content or data)</li>\n<li>an <strong>attribution</strong> licence just says that you must give attribution to the publisher</li>\n<li>an <strong>attribution & share-alike</strong> licence says that you must give attribution and share any derived content or data under the same licence</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"howdoyouprovideattribution\">How Do You Provide Attribution?</h3>\n<p>You should provide attribution even if the licence does not require it. Giving attribution is a way of recognising both the efforts that the publisher has made to put together the content or data you are reusing, and their generosity in making it available for reuse.</p>\n<p>When content or data is licensed using a licence that includes attribution, the publisher might specify:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>what wording the attribution should include</li>\n<li>where and how the attribution should be presented</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should follow what the publisher asks you to do. If it is not practical, for example if you are providing a service that does not have room for the attribution statement that they request, then get in touch with them to ask what to do.</p>\n<p>It is good practice to provide the name of the organisation that published the data or content, and a link to their home page. Specifying the name of the dataset and providing a link to its location also helps other reusers to find the data you are reusing.</p>\n<p>If you are building a tool that reuses some content or data, you should try to include attribution on every page or screen in which the content or data is used. If this is impractical (for example because you are pulling together information from lots of different sources), you should provide a clear link to a page or screen that then provides attribution information.</p>\n<p>If you are republishing data or content, its reusers are still bound by the attribution requirements of the original data or content. To make it easier for them to understand and fulfil those requirements, it is good practice to include the attribution for the source data or content in the attribution that you ask for. This might sometimes be impractical, for example because you are creating derived data or content includes data or content from a large number of sources. In these cases, you should provide a full list of the sources and request an attribution which links to that list.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howdoyousharealike\">How Do You Share-Alike?</h3>\n<p>A share-alike licence requires you to republish new content or data that you create using the given content or data under the same, share-alike licence. Creating new ways of presenting data does not count as derivation or adaptation, but combining two sets of data to create a new set probably does.</p>\n<p>Publishing the content and data that you create from open data, as open data, is a good thing to do even if the licence does not require it. Opening up your content and data enables others to reuse and build on your work, and can add value to your work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatopenlicencesarethere\">What Open Licences Are There?</h2>\n<p>There are two sets of open licences that you may encounter.</p>\n<h3 id=\"openlicencesforcreativecontent\">Open Licences for Creative Content</h3>\n<p>Creative content, such as text, photographs, slides and so on, may be licensed using a <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/\">Creative Commons Licence</a>. There are three of these that you might encounter:</p>\n<table class=\"table\"><thead><tr><th>Level of Licence</th><th>Creative Commons Licence</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>public domain</td><td><a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0\">CC0</a></td></tr><tr><td>attribution</td><td><a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC-by</a></td></tr><tr><td>attribution & share-alike</td><td><a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC-by-sa</a></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>There are different versions for each of these licences, the most recent being version 4.0. There are also different variants which take into account differences in the law in different countries. The links in the table above are to the version 4.0 versions, which apply internationally, but you may find publishers using other versions. You can reuse content under these licences no matter what country you are in.</p>\n<p>There are other types of Creative Commons licences that are not open licences. For example, the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial licence does not allow commercial reuse of content, and therefore is not an open licence. The human-readable summaries of the Creative Commons licences spell out exactly what you can do under each licence.</p>\n<h3 id=\"openlicencesfordatabases\">Open Licences for Databases</h3>\n<p>You might encounter a similar set of licences which is available for databases from the <a href=\"http://opendatacommons.org/\">Open Data Commons</a>. There are again three levels:</p>\n<table class=\"table\"><thead><tr><th>Level of Licence</th><th>Open Data Commons Licence</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>public domain</td><td><a href=\"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/\">PDDL</a></td></tr><tr><td>attribution</td><td><a href=\"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/\">ODC-by</a></td></tr><tr><td>attribution & share-alike</td><td><a href=\"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/\">ODbL</a></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"otherlicences\">Other Licences</h3>\n<p>There are other licences that enable reuse and which you may encounter, particularly around public sector information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/\">Open Government Licence</a></strong> is an attribution licence that covers both copyright and database right and is mainly used for information made available by UK central government</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/opendata/licensing.html\">OS Open Licence</a></strong> is an attribution licence that is exactly the same as the Open Government Licence but ensures that the attribution is to the Ordnance Survey</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howisthelicenceindicated\">How is the Licence Indicated?</h2>\n<p>The licence under which information is published should be clear both in human-readable content and as machine-readable data. If you cannot work out the licence for information that you discover on the web, you should contact the owner of the site to ask: the lack of licensing information means that you cannot assume the right to reuse the content or data.</p>\n<p>Human-readable descriptions and marks that you may encounter are shown on the Creative Commons and Open Data Commons websites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/choose/\">Creative Commons licence chooser</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/\">Open Data Commons licences</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where possible, the publisher should have embedded information about the licence directly within the content or data itself. Often, however, you will have to look at the page from which you access the content or data, or the licence information for the entire website, which is often linked to from the footer of the page.</p>\n<p>If a publisher adds their dataset to a catalog, such as <a href=\"http://data.gov.uk/\">data.gov.uk</a> or the <a href=\"http://datahub.io/\">Data Hub</a>, they may indicate the licence under which the dataset is available in the metadata supplied by the catalog. You should check that this is consistent with any licence information they supply on their own site or within the data itself: if it is not, you should ask them for clarification.</p>\n<h2 id=\"furtherreading\">Further Reading</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://opendatacommons.org/faq/licenses/\">Open Data Commons Licensing FAQ</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h2>\n<p>Very many thanks to <a href=\"http://www.francisdavey.co.uk/\">Francis Davey</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ldodds.com/\">Leigh Dodds</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.ouseful.info/\">Tony Hirst</a>, and the anonymous commenters who contributed comments on this draft.</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/save-the-titanic-handson-anonymisation-and-risk-control-of-publishing-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/guides/save-the-titanic-handson-anonymisation-and-risk-control-of-publishing-open-data","slug":"save-the-titanic-handson-anonymisation-and-risk-control-of-publishing-open-data","title":"Save the Titanic: Hands-on anonymisation and risk control of publishing open data","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:56:22+00:00","created_at":"2014-07-22T16:17:21+00:00","tag_ids":["guide"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/guide.json","web_url":null,"title":"Guide","details":{"description":"Guide","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=guide","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/guide","slug":"guide"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"This guide on anonymisation is based on a presentation at the [OK festival](http://2014.okfestival.org/) on the 16th July 2014.

This will guide your decisions of preserving or obscuring information on Titanic passengers. It will also help understand your audience and what happens next, once you have released the data.</p>\n<p>For the Titanic passenger data we discuss two putative use cases. \n<img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/ce/94/53ce94c4f362be08ad000021/Slide04.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"53ce94c41f986a08aa000050\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"thetradeoffbetweenusefulnessandprotectingprivacy\">The trade-off between usefulness and protecting privacy</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/ce/92/53ce9241d0d462082d00002b/Slide05.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"53ce92411f986a08aa000049\"></p>\n<p>In our case removing direct identifier means deleting the <code>name</code> column. You may also omit other variables that are not really useful such as the <code>ticket number</code>. However deleting <code>fare</code>, for example, may be too much, considering its potential interest to the user.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesitmeantobeidentified\">What does it mean to be 'identified'?</h2>\n<p>An individual is <strong>identified</strong> if you have distinguished that individual from other members of a group. An unusual name may be enough.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/ce/92/53ce92431f986a08a700003e/Slide06.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"53ce92431f986a08aa00004a\"></p>\n<p>However, there are also <strong>indirect identifiers</strong>. The <a href=\"http://ukanon.net/\">UK Anonymisation Network</a> writes: </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When a dataset is anonymised, the identifiers are removed, obscured, aggregated or altered to prevent identification. The term \"identifiers\" is often misunderstood to simply mean formal identifiers such as the name, address or, for example, the NHS number. But, identifiers could in principle include any piece of information; what is identifying will depend on context. For instance, if a group of individuals is known to contain only one woman, then the gender will be identifying for the woman (and gender is not a typical identifier). Identifiers can also be constructed out of combinations of attributes (for example, consider a \"sixteen year old widow\" or a \"15 year old male University Student\" or a \"female Bangladeshi bank manager living in Thurso\"). [adapted]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The most common variables that are not direct identifiers but carry a high risk:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>dates (e.g. birth, admission, discharge, ...)</li>\n<li>geolocators (e.g. post codes, spatial data)</li>\n<li>age</li>\n<li>unusual education (e.g. PhD in statistical disclosure control procedures)</li>\n<li>unusual occupation (e.g. organiser of the OK Festival).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"anonymisingthetitanicpassengerdata\">Anonymising the Titanic passenger data</h2>\n<p>After inspecting the data, we discussed the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Grouping</strong> variables, for example <code>age</code>, creating an age grouping that goes from 0-14, 15-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65 and above. Another variable that may benefit from grouping is <code>home destination</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Censoring</strong> the Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard (<code>sibsp</code>) at 4, i.e. recode 4, 5, 8 to \"4 and more\". </li>\n<li><strong>Perturbing</strong>, i.e. adding some random noise, to the <code>fare</code> variable (see below).</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/ce/92/53ce9245d0d462082d00002d/Slide07.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"53ce92451f986a08aa00004b\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"furtheranonymisationmethods\">Further anonymisation methods</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/ce/92/53ce92471f986a08a7000040/Slide08.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"53ce92471f986a08aa00004c\"></p>\n<p>If a combination of variables leaves only one passenger, he or she might be identified. One practical way to inspect if there are risky combinations, that is low counts, are <strong>pivot tables</strong>. In Google spreadsheets you can create one over the following menu item. Other statistical software such as <a href=\"http://cran.r-project.org\">R</a> has more advanced methods.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/ce/92/53ce9247d0d462082d00002f/Slide09.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"53ce9247f362be08a6000058\"> </p>\n<p>For a three-way cross-tabulation between <code>survived</code>, <code>sex</code> and passenger class <code>pclass</code> we see how there are only 5 women in the first class who did not survive the disaster. Combined with other information about family or husband this may be an identifying combination. \n<img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/ce/92/53ce9249d0d462082d000031/Slide10.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"53ce9249d0d462083b000035\"></p>\n<p>Other methods we discussed were:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Sampling</strong>, which means instead of releasing 1309 rows, we only release a random sample. This is especially useful for large datasets, for example, energy consumption of millions of households. </li>\n<li><strong>Local supression</strong>, some unique passengers, for example a family with three daughters, may stand out too much and we may decide to remove some data. This could mean omitting the passengers or just some information e.g. the number of siblings. </li>\n<li><strong>Aggregate data</strong>, for example average fare by passenger class or a cross-table of survived, sex and a child indicator. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>More information is in the ICO code of practice on anonymisation, <a href=\"http://ico.org.uk/for_organisations/data_protection/topic_guides/~/media/documents/library/Data_Protection/Practical_application/anonymisation-codev2.pdf\">available online</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"intrudertesting\">Intruder testing</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/ce/98/53ce9828d0d462082d000033/Slide11.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"53ce9828f362be08a6000059\"></p>\n<p>No anonymisation is complete without a test of whether it is possible to identify an individual. The ICO speaks of a <strong>motivated intruder</strong> test. There are many variations of this, but the basic question is what can a motivated intruder learn about an individual. </p>\n<p>In general, there are two main ways for re-identification:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An intruder takes personal data it already has and searches an anonymised dataset for a match. </li>\n<li>An intruder takes a record from an anonymised dataset and seeks a match in publicly available information. </li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"twoscenariosforthetitanicpassengerdata\">Two scenarios for the Titanic passenger data</h2>\n<p>We constructed two scenarios:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/ce/92/53ce924bf362be08ad00001d/Slide12.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"53ce924b1f986a08aa00004e\"></p>\n<p>In the first scenario, some people were able to find the ticket price. (Send me an <a href=\"ulrich@theodi.org\">email</a> if you have a guess.) In the limited time, our methods did not take into account some unique families on the ship. </p>\n<p>In the second scenario anonymisation proved more successful because we had introduced a 'noisy fare'. However, there may still be some clever ways to get around it, at least for some passengers.  </p>\n<p>Remember: anonymisation is a trade-off between useful data and protecting privacy. We have to accept that the risk is bigger than zero.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rulesofthumbs\">Rules of thumbs</h2>\n<p>Anonymised data is exempt under the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA). Moreover, the DPA recognises that the risk of anonymisation is never zero. Publishing anonymised data is <em>not</em> a disclosure of personal data. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/ce/92/53ce924c1f986a08a7000044/Slide13.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"53ce924cd0d462083b000036\"></p>\n<p>You have to assess the risk of anonymisation on a case-by-case basis. A useful place to start is to consider how complicated and how sensitive your information is; that is how much could a person be harmed by re-identification. We have provided a few examples on our chart as a suggestion.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/ce/92/53ce924ef362be08ad00001f/Slide14.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"53ce924e1f986a08aa00004f\"></p>\n<p>Aggregation, for example averages by region, is an effective method for mitigating the risk of publishing information about an individual. Data is shown as statistics or cross-tables. Crucial considerations for this anonymisation methods are around small numbers (low counts) and whether publishing multiple tables may be used for re-identification. </p>\n<p>The Open Government Licence does not cover personal data. However, it can be used for anonymised data because it is no longer personal. </p>\n<h2 id=\"furtherreading\">Further reading</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/data-sharing-is-not-open-data\">Shared data is not open data</a></li>\n<li>ICO (2012).

creating resilient data ecosystems</a>, seeks to go further, looking at the ways in which data must be managed to allow it to break out of the many silos that exist within and between organisations, and across open data repositories. </p>\n<p>This will help more people and organisations to benefit from data's use and impacts across the whole <a href=\"https://theodi.org/data-spectrum\">Data

making your data shareable by default will help you overcome challenges in building your organisation’s capacity to innovate with data.</p>\n<p>If you are <strong>responsible for managing datasets</strong> you can learn a set of frameworks and approaches that help ensure effective data management and use.</p>\n<p>The challenges of making data shareable by default are more likely to be around issues of perspective and culture than technology.

Open data is <a href=\"http://theodi.org/what-is-open-data\">data that anyone can access, use and share</a>. A growing number of public and private sector organisations are drafting open data policies that outline how they intend to openly publish data. Increasingly many organisations are also relying on open data published by governments and by other organisations in their sector. An open data policy can also help encourage informed reuse of third-party data.</p>\n<p>A well-written open data policy will clearly define the commitment of the organisation to publishing, sharing and consuming data. It will be used by internal stakeholders to help identify and prioritise releases, and by external stakeholders to understand how an organisation will be releasing its data and ways in which they can be involved. </p>\n<p>The ODI believes that creation of an open data policy is an important element of developing a strong open data practice.</p>\n<p>This guidance is intended to support the drafting of both new and revised policies, and review and feedback on the content of existing policies. The guidance draws on an informal review of both publicly shared policy documents, as well as those shared with the ODI for feedback. </p>\n<h3 id=\"whatmakesagoodopendatapolicykeyelements\">What makes a good open data policy: key elements</h3>\n<p>An open data policy will include some general context that helps to define its scope.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>a definition of open data</strong> – why it is important to the organisation and the reasons for defining a policy</li>\n<li><strong>a general declaration of principles</strong> that should guide the release and reuse of open data</li>\n<li><strong>an outline of the types of data</strong> collected by the organisation and whether they are covered by the policy</li>\n<li><strong>references to any relevant legislation, policies or other guidance</strong> which also apply to the management and sharing of information with third-parties</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clearly stating the scope of a policy will help all stakeholders to reach a common understanding of how, when and where it should be applied.</p>\n<p><strong>A good policy will also consider the following elements:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>approach to identifying and prioritising data for release</strong> – how will data be inventoried, reviewed and then released?</li>\n<li><strong>privacy considerations</strong> – ensuring that personal information is not released by mistake and recommending steps to mitigate, e.g. by undertaking privacy impact assessments or approaches to anonymisation</li>\n<li><strong>data licensing and reuse rights</strong> – this will include not only the licence under which data will be released, but also the importance of clearing rights during data collection</li>\n<li><strong>data publishing standards</strong> – ensuring that data is shared in well-structured, machine-readable formats, with clear metadata and documentation</li>\n<li><strong>engaging with reusers</strong> – how the organisation will work with external stakeholders to help guide release of data and ensure it can be easily used, </li>\n<li><strong>measuring success</strong> – what metrics the organisation will use to measure whether the policy is successful and how these measures will be shared</li>\n<li><strong>approach to consuming open data</strong> – for organisations that are reusing open data, guidance on how to identify high quality datasets and ensure reuse rights are clear</li>\n<li><strong>concrete commitments</strong> – what the organisation is committing to do, in concrete terms, over the timespan of the policy</li>\n<li><strong>policy transparency</strong> – how the policy and the processes it describes will be reviewed based on feedback from stakeholders and lessons learned</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A policy document won't necessarily include detailed information on each of these areas, e.g. specific standards or release processes. It will instead focus on general principles that should be followed and which may inform the drafting of more detailed guidance for practitioners. </p>\n<p>The following sections provide checklists of policy elements that can inform the drafting and review of open data policies. The <a href=\"http://theodi.org/maturity-model\">open data maturity model</a> also includes relevant guidance that highlights how an mature organisation will implement a number of the more detailed processes and policies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"policycontext\">Policy context</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Is there <a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/closed-shared-open-data-whats-in-a-name\">a clear definition of closed, shared and open data</a>?</li>\n<li>Does the policy outline why publishing and consuming open data is of benefit to the organisation?</li>\n<li>Does the policy describe the types of data that the organisations collects and stores, with an indication of which types of dataset might be suitable for release?</li>\n<li>Does the policy reference relevant legislation or other organisational policies and best practices that are relevant to the application of the policy?</li>\n<li>Is there a clear declaration of the principles that underpin the policy?

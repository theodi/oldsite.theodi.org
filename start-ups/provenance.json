Whether it’s a new surfboard or an old satchel. Each Provenance'd product comes with information about who made it, where and out of what.</p>\n<p>Provenance is a platform for transparency. It’s built on open data of many kinds. We believe revealing the truth about how something is made can help us buy better things, both for the environment and for societies near and far.</p>\n<p>We aren't claiming to be 'ethical' or 'sustainable'. Instead, we are striving for both those things through complete commitment to openness and honesty. Our product and company stories are always told by experienced journalists and supported by open data feeds, all of which you can explore and add to.</p>\n<p>\u0002\n<a href=\"/case-studies/provenance-case-study\">Case Study</a></p>\n<p>\u0002</p>","excerpt":"[Provenance](http://www.projectprovenance.com/) helps makers tell the true stories behind their products to customers.\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"ODI Startup: Provenance ","url":"www.provenance.it","telephone":"","twitter":"provenanceHQ","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/project-provenance","email":"hello@provenance.it","joined_at":"2013-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","graduated":"2014-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","tagline":"","involvement":"","want_to_meet":"","case_study":"526196f8c0c715e815004488","organizations":[],"author":{}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{}}

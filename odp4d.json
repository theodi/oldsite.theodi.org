For each sector, we map out relevant datasets and examples of real-world open data application and tools. We then offer a starting point and a menu of options to help decision- and policy-makers choose datasets to release as open data.</p>\n<p><strong>Promoting organisational change</strong> <br>\nMany governments are realising the potential value of open data, but bringing about organisational change to <strong>make open data sustainable</strong> is often challenging. To help governments prepare for transition, we launched a white paper that sets out recommendations for <a href=\"http://theodi.org/open-data-in-government-how-to-bring-about-change\" title=\"open data in government: how to bring about change\">open data in government: how to bring about change</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Benchmarking open data</strong> <br>\nAs open data becomes more widespread and useful, so does the need for effective ways to analyse it. <a href=\"http://theodi.org/guides/benchmarking-data-automatically\" title=\"Benchmarking open data automatically\">Benchmarking open data automatically</a> explores <strong>individual dimensions of open data research</strong>, and assesses how feasible it would be to conduct <strong>automated assessments</strong> of them.</p>\n<p><strong>Case studies</strong> <br>\nDetailed case studies drill into how open data has been applied in <a href=\"http://theodi.org/case-studies/mexico-case-study-using-data-squads-to-jump-start-government-open-data-publishing\" title=\"Mexico\">Mexico</a>, <a href=\"http://theodi.org/case-studies/case-study-a-profile-of-open-data-initiatives-in-macedonia\" title=\"Macedonia\">Macedonia</a> and <a href=\"http://theodi.org/case-studies/case-study-a-profile-of-open-data-initiatives-in-moldova\" title=\"Moldova\">Moldova</a>, highlighting what worked well and what the challenges were. Another covers how global health watchdog <a href=\"http://theodi.org/case-studies/aidspan-case-study-a-watchdog-organisation-in-the-health-sector\" title=\"Aidspan\">Aidspan</a> uses open data to keep track of Global Fund health spending. </p>\n<p><strong>Technical assistance</strong> <br>\nWe provided technical assistance and mentoring in <a href=\"http://theodi.org/news/burkina-faso-launches-open-data-initiative-with-mentoring-from-the-odi-and-funding-from-the-world-bank\" title=\"Burkina Faso\">Burkina Faso</a>, <a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/latin-america-paves-the-way-for-smart-cities-and-open-data-startups\" title=\"Mexico\">Mexico</a> and <a href=\"http://theodi.org/news/open-data-readiness-assessment\" title=\"Botswana\">Botswana</a>, helping governments to launch their own open data initiatives and harness the benefits of open data more broadly. </p>\n<p>To understand more about our work, watch these talks from the <a href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/\" title=\"2014 ODI Summit\">2014 ODI Summit</a>, by Liz Carolan, International Development Manager, and Alfred M.

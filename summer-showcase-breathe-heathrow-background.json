Many said they were very irritated by noise levels and extremely concerned at pollution levels – especially during the summer months – as far out as Twickenham, Kingston, Brentford and Windsor. These areas had not been well-monitored for air or noise pollution, making the impact in those areas difficult to assess.</p>\n    <p>The immediate area around the airport is covered by some <a href=\"http://www.heathrowairwatch.org.uk/documents/AQ_briefing_2015_Q2.pdf\" title=\"Heathrow Air Watch\">14 automatic monitoring stations</a> belonging to Heathrow Airport Limited (HAL), local authorities and the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs (Defra). These cover areas such as Slough, Hounslow and Hillingdon and are also in the immediate vicinity of the runways. There is not much in the way of monitoring air quality outside of this chain of sensors.</p>\n    <p>The <i>Breathe Heathrow</i> team was interested in the spread and behaviour of pollution in these areas further from the airport, how it could be modelled, how secondary datasets – such as flight data, weather and local traffic data – could help them <b>build a more concrete picture of air pollution in the area,</b> combined with community produced air and noise data outside the immediate vicinity of the airport.</p>\n    <p><i>Breathe Heathrow</i> offers a repeatable data-driven methodology and helps local authorities use data for urban planning and development. It also serves as a useful learning experience in how to foster bottom-up, open data-driven solutions for smarter cities, and highlights obstacles that similar initiatives may face in the future. </p>\n\n    <div>\n      <a href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow-about-the-data\" title=\"Next page\"><img class=\"pull-right\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/16/43/56164300f362be08b400000f/summer_showcase_next_but.svg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n      <a href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow\" title=\"Previous page\"><img class=\"pull-left\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/29/f4/5629f4fe1f986a081e000033/previous.svg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n    </div>\n\n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"pull-left col-md-3\">\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow\">About</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box-opacity\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow-background\">Background</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow-about-the-data\">About the data</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow-methodology\">Methodology</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow-lessons-learnt\">Lessons learnt</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow-collaboration\">Collaboration</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow-what-next\">What next?</a>\n    </div>\n\n  </div>\n</div>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

Our 2015 report highlights many tangible impacts that our partners, members, startups and community have achieved with data over the year. </p>\n<p>Burkina Faso used open data to achieve its first free and fair election for nearly 30 years. Arup embraced ODI Startups to build an innovative open supplier ecosystem. Syngenta opened its product data and Defra committed to open up 8,000 datasets by summer 2016.</p>\n<p>To address confusion around the language of data, we created a Data Spectrum and Data Lexicon, and broadened our work to span the whole spectrum, from closed to shared to open, with a focus on treating data as infrastructure. </p>\n<p>We worked to connect UK data innovators with government. We delivered a framework to HM Treasury for open standards in banking. We helped set the agenda for open data in agriculture and nutrition and explored what truly open cities would look like. </p>\n<p>This was all driven by the commitment of the 3,000+ people we’ve trained, the 1,000+ people in our ODI Member community, the 25+ ODI Nodes in 20 countries, the dozens of ODI Startups building products and services and a dedicated team at ODI HQ providing key insights, energy and support. </p>\n<p>The impact for the ODI is that we have refined our mission: we connect, equip and inspire people around the world to innovate with data. We have a remit to drive open innovation, working across the Data Spectrum, with the expertise you would expect from us as an institute. </p>\n<p><strong>Gavin Starks</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/311714343/content?start_page=1&view_mode=slideshow&access_key=key-kiZPJKCZIrLb9kXMVh1g&show_recommendations=true\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.6731488406881077\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_62101\" width=\"100%\" height=\"800\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odis-second-year-annual-report.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odis-second-year-annual-report","slug":"odis-second-year-annual-report","title":"ODI's 2nd Year: Annual Report","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:59:16+00:00","created_at":"2015-02-18T11:07:28+00:00","tag_ids":["page","annual-report"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odis-first-year-annual-report.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odis-first-year-annual-report","slug":"odis-first-year-annual-report","title":"ODI's First Year: Annual Report","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:52:46+00:00","created_at":"2013-11-01T12:11:27+00:00","tag_ids":["page"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

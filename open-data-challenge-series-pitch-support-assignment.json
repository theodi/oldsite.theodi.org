We’ve already delivered three challenges in their entirety and the other four are all underway. The methodology for the challenge process culminates in a two day event which we call a ‘creation weekend’ – the purpose of which is to support teams to refine, develop and pitch their product or service to win one of three £5,000 prizes, access to a tailored package of incubation support and the opportunity to win the final £40,000 – £50,000 prize. </p>\n<p>We’re asking a lot of the teams at this event – and many of them haven’t pitched before. So, at the housing creation weekend, we tested the involvement of a ‘pitch expert’ – someone to support and challenge the teams over the weekend as they create and deliver a 4 minute pitch on the Sunday afternoon. We now know that this is a useful addition to the weekend and would like to invite pitch experts to take this assignment on for future creation weekends. </p>\n<p><strong>Who are we looking for?</strong>\nAre you a serial startup CEO? Are you a startup advisor? Are you comfortable coaching others in a pressured environment and comfortable giving succinct, constructive feedback? Perhaps you’ve pitched as part of your day job and would like to get involved in the startup scene. </p>\n<p><strong>What is the assignment?</strong>\nThe creation weekend will be the focus of your assignment. Over a 48 hour period at this event, we will bring together c. 15 teams to develop, refine and pitch their product or solution. </p>\n<p><strong>You will be responsible for:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>understanding their propositions - reviewing their submissions on our application platform and spending time with the teams</li>\n<li>reiterating our pitch expectations</li>\n<li>sharing ‘top tips’ for participants in a short presentation on Saturday afternoon</li>\n<li>running a ‘pitch practice/clinic’ throughout the weekend - to include 1:1 sessions to review and feedback on their pitch style/content and delivery</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will need to reflect and represent the ODI/Nesta pitch guidance at all times.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the commitment?</strong>\nIn the first instance, the contract will relate specifically to the Food Challenge Creation Weekend (15/16 November 2014). On successful completion, and assuming the feedback from the participants is positive, we will then look to extend the contract to include delivery of pitch support for final two challenges (one weekend in February and another in April 2015). </p>\n<p><strong>What’s the reward?</strong>\nWe have a small budget available for this assignment. Please propose a day rate along with your expression of interest.</p>\n<p><strong>Want to express interest or ask questions?</strong>\nPlease send Briony Phillips <a href=\"mailto:(briony.phillips@theodi.org)\" title=\"(briony.phillips@theodi.org)\">(briony.phillips@theodi.org)</a> two paragraphs describing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What you’ve pitched before and what you have learnt</li>\n<li>Who you’ve coached before and to what end</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please also include a link to your LinkedIn profile (or equivalent) and your proposed day rate. Do make sure you share this information by the deadline of <strong>on or before midday Friday, 30 October 2014</strong>. We will review your expression of interest and invite a few people to pitch themselves to us on Wednesday, 5 November 2014. </p>\n<p>Finally, please keep the creation weekend dates in your diary!</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/opendatachallengeseries.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/opendatachallengeseries","slug":"opendatachallengeseries","title":"Open Data Challenge Series","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-11-09T12:15:14+00:00","created_at":"2012-12-13T09:45:46+00:00","tag_ids":["page","event:open-data-challenge-series","challenge-series","open-data"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{}}

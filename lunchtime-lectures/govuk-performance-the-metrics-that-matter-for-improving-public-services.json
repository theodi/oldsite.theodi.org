We show the metrics that matter to the civil servants who provide government services.</p>\n<p>All the dashboards are public – no usernames or passwords – so the government is accountable for the services it provides. We're making the map of the UK's public services and how they connect together. And we're building this map around the user needs of citizens and businesses.</p>\n<p>Listen in on how we're using data to help government meet the needs of citizens and businesses.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.manofscience.co.uk/\">Henry Hadlow</a> is a designer interested in digital services and beautiful typography.

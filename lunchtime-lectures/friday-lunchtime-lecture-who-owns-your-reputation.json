A recent <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/527985/bis-16-259-helping-consumers-get-a-better-deal.pdf\">call for evidence</a> from the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills (BIS) asks, among other things, whether the subjects of ratings and reviews, such as Uber drivers, should be able to take their reputations data with them when they join new services. </p>\n<p>Who ‘owns’ data and so could move it between services? What rights currently exist? What needs to change? Who benefits and who loses from greater data portability?</p>\n<p>This debate takes place against the backdrop of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the EU Free Flow of Data initiative, which both take on aspects of data portability. Join the debate and share your views with speakers including Director of Lateral Economics, economist Nicholas Gruen; Assistant Director for the Strategy Unit (BIS), Tom Gelderd; FT Alphaville’s Izabella Kaminska, and ODI Head of Policy Ellen Broad.</p>\n<h2 id=\"livestream\">Live stream</h2>\n<p>We're sorry but, due to unforeseen circumstances, we won't be live streaming this lunchtime lecture.

Although the UK is the world leader in releasing open data, its use in informing real world solutions has been limited and fragmented, with innovative startups sometimes lacking support and data expertise to scale to a sustainable business level. </p>\n<p>In this lunchtime lecture we heard from the final winners of the first three <a href=\"http://theodi.org/challenge-series\">Open Data Challenges</a> - individuals who have developed a solution to a specific social issue and been supported through their journey by the Open Data Challenge Series to win £40,000. Topics ranged from helping parents engage with their child’s learning to enabling community energy groups to engage with energy efficiency interventions. </p>\n<iframe class=\"pull-right\" width=\"500px\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/157290870&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<iframe style=\"float:left; max-width:100%;\" width=\"600px\" height=\"400px\" class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"//www.scribd.com/embeds/232594611/content?start_page=1&view_mode=slideshow&access_key=key-5Qn85tQuiobOHzK2P42T&show_recommendations=false\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.7790927021696252\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_54392\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>","excerpt":"You bring your lunch, we provide tea & coffee, an interesting talk, and enough time to get back to your desk.\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: Open data innovations for social good","end_date":"2014-07-04T12:50:00+00:00","location":"Open Data Institute, 65 Clifton Street, London, EC2A 4JE","start_date":"2014-07-04T12:00:00+00:00","booking_url":"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/friday-lunchtime-lecture-open-data-innovations-for-social-good-tickets-11942130233","hashtag":"ODIFridays","event_type":"event:lunchtime-lecture","organizations":[],"author":{}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-data-challenge-series-open-data-innovation-changing-communities-and-energy-usage-for-the-better.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures/open-data-challenge-series-open-data-innovation-changing-communities-and-energy-usage-for-the-better","slug":"open-data-challenge-series-open-data-innovation-changing-communities-and-energy-usage-for-the-better","title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: How the Open Data Challenge Series is creating community, energy & open data innovation","format":"event","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:55:44+00:00","created_at":"2014-05-15T10:11:44+00:00","tag_ids":["event:lunchtime-lecture"],"extras":{"start_date":"2014-05-23T12:00:00+00:00","end_date":"2014-05-23T12:50:00+00:00","location":"Open Data Institute, 65 Clifton Street, London, EC2A 4JE"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/friday-lunchtime-lecture-what-open-data-do-we-need-for-a-cleaner-greener-world.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures/friday-lunchtime-lecture-what-open-data-do-we-need-for-a-cleaner-greener-world","slug":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-what-open-data-do-we-need-for-a-cleaner-greener-world","title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: What open data do we need for a greener, cleaner world?

This gives us unprecedented access to explore changes, divisions and inequalities across the UK with data ranging from ethnicity to tenure to Townsend deprivation score. </p>\n<p>In this lunchtime lecture <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/nickbearmanuk\">Dr Nick Bearman</a> will explain how his team took the disparate Census geographies of enumeration districts and output areas and transformed them into a 1km grid across Great Britain. Nick discusses how and why they implemented the project with a range of open methodologies, open source languages and resources, and licensing our outputs with open data and source code licenses. </p>\n<h3 id=\"aboutdrnickbearman\">About Dr Nick Bearman</h3>\n<p>Nick is Senior GIS Analyst and Course Director at <a href=\"http://www.clearmapping.co.uk/\">Clear Mapping Co</a>, an award winning international cartographic design and GIS training consultancy.

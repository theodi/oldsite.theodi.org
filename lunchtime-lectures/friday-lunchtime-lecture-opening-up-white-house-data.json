We'll also briefly discuss key legislation, including the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) focused on transparency in financial reporting, as well as the Open Government Data Act, which is currently before Congress and would codify requirements for a new more rigorous open data programme in the federal government.  </p>\n<p><strong>Please note: This lunchtime lecture is taking place on a Wednesday, not our usual Friday slot.</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"aboutmattlaessig\">About Matt Laessig</h3>\n<p>Matt Laessig is the co-founder and COO of data.world, a leading collaboration and community platform which makes it easier for people to work on data projects. </p>\n<p>Matt has been an entrepreneur and executive in the technology industry for the last 20 years.

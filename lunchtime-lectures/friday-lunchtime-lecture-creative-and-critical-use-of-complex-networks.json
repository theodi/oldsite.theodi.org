From the social graph to the knowledge graph, the interest graph to the transactions graph, proprietary data networks drive the generation of new power and capital.</p>\n<p>Such graphs are used to make algorithmic predictions and optimisations about our future activities. Only those who can aggregate and hedge raw data emerge as the new power players. This situation creates a new imbalance of power, which can be understood with the concept of data asymmetry.</p>\n<p>In fact, mapping and analysing data networks provide immense opportunities to civil society. In this talk, Burak Arıkan will present the <a href=\"http://www.graphcommons.com\">Graph Commons</a> platform and how individuals and small organisations use it to transform their data into interactive maps and untangle complex relations that impact them and their communities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"aboutburakarikan\">About Burak Arikan</h3>\n<p>Burak Arikan is a New York and Istanbul-based artist working with complex networks. He takes the obvious social, economical and political issues as input and runs through an abstract machinery, which generates network maps and algorithmic interfaces, results in performances and procreates predictions to render inherent power relationships visible and discussable. Arikan’s software, prints, installations, and performances have been featured in numerous exhibitions internationally. Arikan is the founder of Graph Commons, a collaborative platform for network mapping, analysis and publishing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"watchlive\">Watch live</h3>\n<p>There will be a live feed of the lunchtime lecture from 1pm on Friday 11 November.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/plMJR4I0uyk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","excerpt":"Friday lunchtime lectures are for everyone and are free to attend.

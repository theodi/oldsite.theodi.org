It's all around us – in the city, on signs, road markings and equipment – and it's been there for some time. In this talk, ODI Senior Consultant <a href=\"https://theodi.org/team/leigh-dodds\">Leigh Dodds</a> will explain how to be a data magpie, and find small pieces of data that are shared – whether deliberately or accidentally – in our cities. Leigh will also explain how looking at data in its natural habitat can give us insights into our data infrastructure and what the future may bring.</p>\n<p><em>Leigh is an experienced software engineer, product manager and technical consultant. He spent 10 years working in the publishing industry dealing with data integration and management issues. As CTO of <a href=\"http://www.publishingtechnology.com/\">Publishing Technology’s</a> scholarly division, Leigh was responsible for designing an innovative publishing framework based on semantic web technology. On moving to <a href=\"http://www.talis-group.com/\">Talis Group</a> in 2011, Leigh looked after their “Data as a Service” products, overseeing product development and launching their Linked Data consulting business.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"bookyourplace\">Book your place</h3>\n<iframe src=\"//eventbrite.co.uk/tickets-external?eid=22047382314&ref=etckt\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"280\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"livestream\">Live stream</h3>\n<p>If you’re unable to attend this lunchtime lecture you don’t need to miss out.

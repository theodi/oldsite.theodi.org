Over the years, they have evolved from straight-up inventory management to online publications with digitised images for all to see.</p>\n<p>In early 2017 the <a href=\"https://group.sciencemuseum.org.uk/\">Science Museum Group</a> relaunched its online collection of digitised objects, under a Creative Commons licence via a public API. The museum hopes that the open data will be used in many ways. Researchers might use it to explore the collection using computation analysis, software programmers might use it to explore new interfaces and discovery tools for the collection, and creatives might use the data and images in their work.</p>\n<p>This lecture will present the outcomes from a hack day held in February to bring together technologists, designers and creatives to experiment with how this open data could be used. The hack day was run as part of the museum’s Digital Lab initiative, supported by Samsung.</p>\n<h3 id=\"aboutthespeakers\">About the speakers</h3>\n<p><strong>John Stack</strong> is Digital Director of the <a href=\"https://group.sciencemuseum.org.uk/\">Science Museum Group</a>.

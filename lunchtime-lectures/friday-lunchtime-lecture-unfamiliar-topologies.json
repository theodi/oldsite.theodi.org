In this talk, Georgina Voss and Wesley Goatley will present and discuss their infrastructure data artwork “Familiars”, which directly intercepted logistical radio signals broadcast by planes, ships, and trains, highlighting the material aspects of data infrastructures. In unpacking the research and development behind “Familiars”, they’ll explore how access to forms of “open” data is mediated and who this data is really intended for. While the UK government is currently investing in the “best” ways to plan, create, and fund vital infrastructure projects, they’ll argue that engaging with crucial questions around control, ownership and access to data requires an understanding of their physical components and context.</p>\n </div>\n\n <div class=\"row\">\n  <p><b>Wesley Goatley</b> is an artist and researcher. </p>\n  <p><b>Georgina Voss</b> is a technology anthropologist, writer, and co-founder of research co-operative “Strange Telemetry”.</p>\n </div>\n\n</div>","excerpt":"<div class=\"container\">\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"ODIFridays at the Open Data Insitute","end_date":"2015-11-20T14:00:00+00:00","location":"Open Data Institute, 65 Clifton Street","start_date":"2015-11-20T13:00:00+00:00","booking_url":"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/friday-lunchtime-lecture-unfamiliar-topologies-tickets-19400800316","hashtag":"ODIFridays","event_type":"event:lunchtime-lecture","organizations":[],"author":{}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/friday-lunchtime-lecture-3d-printing-shaping-the-engineering-of-the-future.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures/friday-lunchtime-lecture-3d-printing-shaping-the-engineering-of-the-future","slug":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-3d-printing-shaping-the-engineering-of-the-future","title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: 3D printing: Shaping the engineering of the future","format":"event","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:57:35+00:00","created_at":"2014-10-10T10:38:18+00:00","tag_ids":["odifridays","event","3d-printing","startup","i-can-make","event:lunchtime-lecture"],"extras":{"start_date":"2014-10-24T12:00:00+00:00","end_date":"2014-10-24T12:50:00+00:00","location":"The Open Data Institute, 65 Clifton Street, London, EC2A 4JE"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/friday-lunchtime-lecture-the-art-of-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures/friday-lunchtime-lecture-the-art-of-data","slug":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-the-art-of-data","title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: The art of data","format":"event","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:58:00+00:00","created_at":"2014-11-12T11:39:34+00:00","tag_ids":["odifridays","art","data-as-culture","james-bridle","event:lunchtime-lecture"],"extras":{"start_date":"2014-11-28T13:00:00+00:00","end_date":"2014-11-28T13:50:00+00:00","location":"The Open Data Institute, 65 Clifton Street, London, EC2A 4JE"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/friday-lunchtime-lecture-oceans-of-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures/friday-lunchtime-lecture-oceans-of-data","slug":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-oceans-of-data","title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: Oceans of data","format":"event","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:55:46+00:00","created_at":"2014-05-21T15:59:30+00:00","tag_ids":["event:lunchtime-lecture"],"extras":{"start_date":"2014-05-30T12:00:00+00:00","end_date":"2014-05-30T12:50:00+00:00","location":"Open Data Institute, 65 Clifton Street, London, EC2A 4JE"}}],"organizations":[],"author":{}}

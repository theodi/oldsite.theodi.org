Having made significant investment in technology over the past five years, Shelter is just beginning to peer into the open data realm and the vast possibilities that lay there. <strong>This talk explores how Shelter is starting out on its open journey</strong>: formulating partnerships, developing pilots and starting to explore how opening our data can help more people. </p>\n<p><em>Paul McMullan is on a mission to unlock the potential of Shelter’s historical data. He has been working in the technology change team at Shelter for five years, implementing CRM technologies.

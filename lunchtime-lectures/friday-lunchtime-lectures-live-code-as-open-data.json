He has developed a pattern-focused approach to algorithmic music and live coding since the year 2000, co-founding the TOPLAP (live coding) and Algorave (algorithmic rave) movements and the TidalCycles live coding environment in the process. He performs and releases solo as Yaxu on the Computer Club label, including the forthcoming crowdfunded album Spicule. As researcher he works on the ERC project PENELOPE, applying live coding techniques to explore the computational processes of ancient weaving. Alex is completing sound artist residency at the Open Data Institute as part of Sound and Music's embedded programme.</p>\n<h3 id=\"livefeed\">Live feed</h3>\n<p>There will be a live stream of Alex's talk on this webpage from 1pm on Friday 2 June.</p>","excerpt":"Friday lunchtime lectures are for everyone and are free to attend.

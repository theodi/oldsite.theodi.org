You bring your lunch, we provide tea and coffee, an interesting talk, and enough time to get back to your desk</strong>.</p>\n<p>At North Pole Incorporated, a data revolution is underway to modernise how Christmas gifts get to girls and boys around the world. </p>\n<p>For hundreds of years, North Pole Inc. and its global network of elvish subsidiaries have been gathering data on what children across the world want for Christmas, who has been naughty or nice and the latest toy trends.</p>\n<p>To meet children’s needs, North Pole Inc. relies on up-to-date information spanning delivery routes (by air, boat and donkey), building entrances and exits, fireplace hazards, stocking sizes, reindeer health, movement and feed. The problem is, the global population is expanding and companies like North Pole Inc. everywhere are being forced to find new, more efficient ways of delivering services. </p>\n<p>This year, a crack team at North Pole Inc. has been working on developing and implementing the data infrastructure that Christmas needs, to keep children happy for years to come. </p>\n<p>Join us on 18 December to hear from North Pole Inc. <strong>CEO, Santa Claus; Head of Deliveries, Reiner Deerdale and Chief Elf Envisioner Sparkle Wonderdust</strong>. </p>\n<p>Look out for surprise guests!</p>\n<p><small class=\"pull-right\"><i>Photo: Flickr -<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregloby/3083873075/in/photolist-vWbF2G-iAwxWa-M6Qq1-fKBtV6-cpCkU-bRTWGn-4NpR81-7LNe1H-o1mFkN-rxwUBe-55GvQS-nrJbzn-93UEHF-6wKAPE-4DPCva-5GSnPt-4G6pp9-6mTTHR-hub9f-dyJ7de-qUiG12-5yMWoC-ziJkU9-e9r6yc-d3ycyu-cKrx1W-4oo77A-iz7Jw1-yaSnk-rRRMKF-6VAyq-e582An-aGhST-qjNVG2-4gxNTE-oMjSM6-fZoiTS-iqNVRR-ixVBiS-pda55o-5GvE2r-qp8u73-qa9sHx-ziKsnq-rWRtow-iaXnrH-9MHnEM-gUWopL-61tSB5-86iYQS\"> Greg Lobinski (CC-BY-2.0)</a></i></small></p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"bookyourplace\">Book your place</h3>\n<iframe src=\"//eventbrite.co.uk/tickets-external?eid=19800719485&ref=etckt\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"214\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"aboutourfridaylunchtimelectures\">About our Friday lunchtime lectures</h3>\n<p>With a broad range of topics in open data such as tracking government expenditure, British landscape mapping and creating art, there’s bound to be something that interests you. </p>\n<p>The sessions run from 1pm to 1.45pm weekly during UK school term-times, with informal networking until 2pm. Each lecture lasts for around 20 minutes, leaving time for questions afterwards. The lectures don't require any specialist knowledge, but are focused around communicating the meaning and impact of open data in all areas of life. </p>\n<p>Each week the lectures are streamed live on YouTube and then uploaded to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/OpenDataInstituteUK\">YouTube</a> and <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/theodiuk\" title=\"Vimeo\">Vimeo</a> channels.

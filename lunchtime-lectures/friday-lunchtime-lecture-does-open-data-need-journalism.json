Jonathan Stoneman has spent the last six months analysing the impact of open data on journalism, and has written a working paper for the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. Even he was surprised by some of his findings.</p>\n<p><em>Jonathan is an Associate Trainer at the ODI. He was a journalist and editor as well as Head of Training at BBC World Service until 2010. As a freelance trainer and consultant he specialises in data journalism with open data. Jonathan is a contributor to the book \"Data journalism: Mapping the Future\", which is being published on 4 November.</em></p>\n<p><small><i><a class=\"pull-right\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/micora/5105225792/in/photolist-8M8BLm-pjdwc-8M8BVw-f8s8L7-5q9GTC-o94zzr-7Xgygq-5zxJwV-dM5UFD-7EkSkA-odApGE-aXMBpz-oRUjUE-dGwhWQ-cgoXPf-c1Cnwo-ekWzj3-byxpkM-8CRGpK-8CRF3a-8CULW9-8CULA9-dBWtWX-57ufvw-7YcFTr-ohLhuF-7cwAWd-79sZuH-7YcFS4-nXrHsX-5NuyRr-eMzhVZ-nwpEPB-oeLuqj-5SMWvF-aBjNxY-kEeLo6-pEwhPh-oBGKms-nFJjH4-nDYNs7-nt56CG-ndHB3y-nYaRvt-nveYsW-nFXriK-ecxMKs-MdFSJ-nVKZNT-poRw8R\">Image: Flickr - Javier Micora (CC BY-SA 2.0)</a></i></small></p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"aboutourfridaylunchtimelectures\">About our Friday lunchtime lectures</h3>\n<p>With a broad range of topics in open data such as tracking government expenditure, British landscape mapping and creating art, there’s bound to be something that interests you. </p>\n<p>The sessions run from 1pm to 1.45pm weekly during UK school term-times, with informal networking until 2pm.

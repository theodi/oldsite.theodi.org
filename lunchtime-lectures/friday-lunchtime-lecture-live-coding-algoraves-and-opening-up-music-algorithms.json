He relates this history to the open data movement, describing how live coders have opened up and shared the underlying structures of their music as free or open source software. Alex wraps up with some thoughts and predictions around where he thinks live coding is going, both in terms of creative practice and its wider cultural influences. </p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://slab.org/\">Alex McLean</a> is a live coding musician and software artist based in Sheffield UK.

Alex co-founded the Algorave and TOPLAP live coding movements, and the AlgoMech festival of algorithmic and mechanical movement, the first edition of which takes place <a href=\"http://airmail.calendar/2016-11-12%2012:00:00%20GMT\">12-20 November 2016</a> in Sheffield.

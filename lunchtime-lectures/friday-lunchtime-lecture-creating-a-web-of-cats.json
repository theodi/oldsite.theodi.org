In this lecture, ODI's Peter Wells explains how a bout of lunchtime whimsy led him to create an open data register of UK government cats. He talks about the tools he used to create the register and dashboard, how people can help collaboratively maintain them on the web and some of the lessons he learnt along the way. He also admits that it wasn't all about cats and talks about how anyone can help strengthen data infrastructure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"aboutpeterwells\">About Peter Wells</h3>\n<p>Peter Wells is a open data policy expert and consultant at the ODI.</p>\n<h3 id=\"livefeed\">Live feed</h3>\n<p>Live feed of today's talk will start at 1pm.

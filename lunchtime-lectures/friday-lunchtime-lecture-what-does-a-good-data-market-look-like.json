What does a good data market place look like?</p>\n<p>Making data more discoverable, accessible and usable is a goal shared by government, businesses, sectors and non profits. How do we realise maximum value of the web of data? What kind of data infrastructure do we need for the discovery, collaboration on and exchanges of data?</p>\n<p>Join us for a thought debate about how we access, use and share data across organisations to maximise the value of the web of data.

Each lecture lasts for around 20 minutes, leaving time for questions afterwards. The lectures don’t require any specialist knowledge, but are focused around communicating the meaning and impact of open data in all areas of life.</p>\n<p>Each week the lectures are streamed live on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/OpenDataInstituteUK\">YouTube</a> and then uploaded to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/OpenDataInstituteUK\">YouTube</a> and <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/theodiuk\">Vimeo</a> channels.

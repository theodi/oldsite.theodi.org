But the necessary tools and expensive licence fees have made this difficult for smaller businesses, who haven’t had the technical skills or funding to invest in accessing and analysing the data.</p>\n<p>But the growth of open data, which is free to use and available to everyone, is changing this. Data and business expert John Murray will explain how open data can be applied to marketing, highlighting case studies where open data has been used to boost direct marketing campaigns, optimise call centre performance, plan store locations and keep customers coming back.</p>\n<p><em>John Murray is CEO of <a href=\"http://www.fusiondatascience.com/\" title=\"Fusion Data Science\">Fusion Data Science</a> and a lecturer in Computer Science at the University of Chester.

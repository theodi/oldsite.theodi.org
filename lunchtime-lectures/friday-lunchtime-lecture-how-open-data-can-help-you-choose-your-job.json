How can open data help you choose your job?</strong></p>\n<p>Choosing a career path isn’t easy. With so many paths to take, it can be difficult to know which would suit us best.</p>\n<p>Open data can help. The UK Commission for Employment and Skills has developed <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lmiforall.org.uk%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGXaFEJ5yzkQMkEB2e70ewaVYaBJw\">‘LMI for All’</a>, an open data portal to support careers guidance. The portal brings together labour market information via an API for developers to present in a variety of ways for wide audiences.</p>\n<p>Come along to this Friday lecture and see some of the ways in which the data is being used, in the ‘iCould’ careers website and beyond.</p>\n<hr />\n<iframe src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/254911386/content?start_page=1&view_mode=slideshow&access_key=key-9F178QUaG1GvN4oSgwGr&show_recommendations=true\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.3323485967503692\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_18562\" width=\"600px\" height=\"400px\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\"></iframe>\n<iframe class=\"pull-right\" width=\"500px\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/189804136&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>","excerpt":"<img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/b3/bb/54b3bb721f986a0849000003/ScreenShot2015-01-12at12.01.29.png\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img pull-right\" id=\"54b3bb72d0d4627cd900004b\">\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"ODIFridays lunchtime lecture","end_date":"2015-02-06T13:50:00+00:00","location":"The Open Data Institute, 65 Clifton Street, London, EC2A 4JE","start_date":"2015-02-06T13:00:00+00:00","booking_url":"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/friday-lunchtime-lecture-how-open-data-can-help-you-choose-your-job-tickets-15269798378","hashtag":"ODIFridays","event_type":"event:lunchtime-lecture","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/friday-lunchtime-lecture-which-university-finding-an-answer-via-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures/friday-lunchtime-lecture-which-university-finding-an-answer-via-open-data","slug":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-which-university-finding-an-answer-via-open-data","title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: Which university?

Each lecture lasts for around 20 minutes, leaving time for questions afterwards. The lectures don't require any specialist knowledge, but are focused around communicating the meaning and impact of open data in all areas of life. </p>\n<p>Each week the lectures are streamed live on YouTube and then uploaded to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/OpenDataInstituteUK\">YouTube</a> and <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/theodiuk\" title=\"Vimeo\">Vimeo</a> channels.

MappingGM has been developed over the last two years in-house by Greater Manchester and Salford City Council staff and has changed the way public sector staff use open geospatial data. MappingGM is also widely used by the development (physical as opposed web) industry and is continually being iterated by the small (2.5 people) MappingGM team.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/friday-lunchtime-lecture-using-open-data-to-map-greater-manchester-tickets-28865084244\">Book now</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"aboutlucywoodbine\">About Lucy Woodbine</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/0f/84/580f844c1f986a0833000005/Lucy_Woodbine_photo.jpg\" alt=\"Lucy2\" class=\"img pull-right\" id=\"580f844bf362be081c000005\"></p>\n<p>Lucy Woodbine leads the team that developed MappingGM, she is the Principal Researcher for Planning and Research for New Economy, Greater Manchester’s strategy and research arm.

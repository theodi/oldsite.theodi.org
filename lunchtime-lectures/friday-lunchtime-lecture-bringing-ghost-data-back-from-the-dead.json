Digital technology has helped us to optimise the utility of data sources for future applications.</p>\n<p>That said, the digital revolution has also led to the destruction of many paper records and datasets in obsolete formats. In many cases, corporate knowledge, along with its underpinning data, has actually declined over the past two decades.</p>\n<p>In this lecture, Michael Weatherburn will share his insights into the scale of this issue, and discuss how we can recover important data to fill gaps in knowledge.</p>\n<h3 id=\"aboutthespeaker\">About the speaker</h3>\n<p>Michael Weatherburn is Deputy Field Leader at <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/\">Imperial College</a> where he completed his PhD on the long-term development of the consultancy sector.

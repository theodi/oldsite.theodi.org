People's rights to consent, privacy, security and ownership are important to keep in mind while collecting, analysing, storing, presenting and reusing data.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, why is responsible data important for the open data movement? How can the principles and practice of responsible data be incorporated into open data initiatives?</p>\n<p>Alix Dunn will talk about the foundations of the responsible data community, where it is headed and how responsible data tactics can inform considerations about what data is made available. She will take a look at how those decisions are made, and how intermediary organisations can help by building responsible data into their strategies. Alix will also look at different sectors that are struggling to understand the potential unintended harm that opening some data can have.</p>\n<h3 id=\"aboutalixdunn\">About Alix Dunn</h3>\n<p><em>Alix is the Executive Director and co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.theengineroom.co.uk/\">The Engine Room</a>, an international organisation that helps social change initiatives and other change agents make the most of data and technology to increase their impact.

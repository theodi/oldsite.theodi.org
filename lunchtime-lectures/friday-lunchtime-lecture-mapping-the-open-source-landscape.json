These days you’re just as likely to find him scrawling on an A3 pad as you are staring at a terminal. Outside of the office Ben enjoys designing board games and racing bicycles.</p>\n<h3 id=\"livefeed\">Live feed</h3>\n<p>A live feed of the Friday lunchtime lecture will be available here from 1pm on Friday 5 May 2017.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GttaMG5lBAI?list=PL6DDzoHu1cx1ozmghXXCgzwHF8Ln8Tlv8?ecver=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h3 id=\"slides\">Slides</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/a/theodi.org/file/d/0B3v_SXN-H931VE0ta25pc0FPUUY4T2Q2YzE3V2xQcW1jR184/view?usp=sharing\">View Ben's slides from the ODI lunchtime lecture</a></p>","excerpt":"Friday lunchtime lectures are for everyone and are free to attend.

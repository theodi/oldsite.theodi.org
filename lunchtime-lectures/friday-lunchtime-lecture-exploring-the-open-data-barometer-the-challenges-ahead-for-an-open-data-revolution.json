Exploring the Open Data Barometer - the challenges ahead for an open data revolution</strong></p>\n<p>Over the last two years the World Wide Web Foundation’s <a href=\"http://barometer.opendataresearch.org/\">Open Data Barometer</a> has surveyed the open data landscape in over 75 countries, building up a picture of progress, and pitfalls, on the road to ‘open by default’.</p>\n<p>The latest edition of the Barometer, launched in January 2015, shows a growing data divide. But it also points to areas where open data is having impact, and highlights factors that appear to contribute to greater political, economic and social outcomes from open data initiatives.</p>\n<p>This week we heard about the Barometer findings, dug deeper into the methodology, heard about how we can re-mix the data (all the underlying data is open data of course), and discussed the future of open data metrics and measurement.</p>\n<p><em>Speakers</em></p>\n<p><strong>Tim Davies</strong> is a PhD candidate at the University of Southampton Web Science Doctoral Training Centre, and Affiliate at the Harvard Berkman Centre for Internet and Society.

Genetic heart conditions, for example, affect around 1% of all newborns, and in around 10 times as many cases they may lead to miscarriage. If we want to prevent or treat birth defects, it’s vital that we understand how different gene mutations affect embryos as they develop.</p>\n<p>The DMDD (Deciphering the Mechanisms of Developmental Disorders) programme is tacking this issue by studying the effects of 240 different gene mutations in mouse embryos. In the spirit of open data, the project has made all its data freely available, to encourage collaboration and, ultimately, lead to better understanding of genetic disease.</p>\n<h3 id=\"aboutthespeaker\">About the speaker</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/a-z-researchers/researchers-k-o/tim-mohun/\">Dr Tim Mohun</a> is a developmental biologist at the Francis Crick Institute in central London. His research group studies the genetic controls that regulate embryo development, focussing on how the heart is formed. Much of his work uses animal models such as the mouse. Tim also coordinates the DMDD programme.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note: The DMDD’s work is based on studies with mice and subscribe to the highest standards for animal welfare in their research. The lecture will include some examples of this work.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/friday-lunchtime-lecture-using-open-data-to-understand-the-causes-of-genetic-birth-defects-tickets-34065073552\"><strong>Book your free place now</strong></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"livefeed\">Live feed</h3>\n<p>A live feed of the Friday lunchtime lecture will be available here from 1pm on Friday 12 May 2017.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZroZwWgD8YU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","excerpt":"Friday lunchtime lectures are for everyone and are free to attend.

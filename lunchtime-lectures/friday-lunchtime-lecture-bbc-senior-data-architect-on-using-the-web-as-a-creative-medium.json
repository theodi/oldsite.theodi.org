We'll cover the BBC's experiments in structured data for storytelling in drama and news, why we need the Internet of Fictional Things, and the alchemic secrets of the Web's pioneers.</p>\n<p><em>Paul Rissen is a Project Manager of the RES project at the BBC, currently helping open the data held by the UK's cultural institutions for use in education, via the RES Project (http://res.space). He pioneered the ‘storyline’ architecture that creates structured data from traditional narratives, allowing audiences and machines alike to explore networks of narrative using RESTful Web architecture. He developed this first in fictional environments – continuing dramas at the BBC including Doctor Who and Eastenders – and adapted it to news, where it has been the basis for new approaches to the presentation of news through the BBC’s website.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"bookyourplace\">Book your place</h3>\n<iframe src=\"//eventbrite.co.uk/tickets-external?eid=24424082087&ref=etckt\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"280\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"livestream\">Live stream</h3>\n<p>If you’re unable to attend this lunchtime lecture you don’t need to miss out.

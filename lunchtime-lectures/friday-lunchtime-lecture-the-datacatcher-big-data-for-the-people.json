The Datacatcher: Big Data for the People</strong></p>\n<p>Earlier this year Goldsmiths University of deployed over 100 bespoke devices to people around London to see how they would shape their experiences of data and the city.  The devices, called <a href=\"http://www.datacatcher.org/\">Datacatchers</a>, show a stream of information drawn from numerous open and shared databases about their local surroundings. With information from the census, marketing sites, governmental agencies, and social media, they mutually illuminate the sociopolitical topology of the UK and the ways data represents that topology â€“ and allow people to speak back by way of a series of somewhat irreverent poll questions. In this talk we describe the making of the Datacatchers, and show a few of the 50+ documentary videos we commissioned to build a picture of peoples' experiences.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/wgaver\">Bill Gaver</a> is Professor of Design and leads the Interaction Research Studio at Goldsmiths, University of London.

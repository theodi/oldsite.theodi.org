What’s the vision for 2016 and what strategies can be employed to better deliver data both within and outside of Parliament? Zeid Hadi, lead on Parliament’s open data development theme, will focus on what’s ahead – discussing how data is currently being used in Parliament and taking a glimpse at some of the applications that are currently being developed by Parliament Digital Service.</p>\n<p><em>Zeid Hadi has led the open data development team at Parliament since 2013. His experience began in leading development in information service and publishing solutions for Reed Elsevier within B2B markets, before moving on to becoming CTO of his own software company Condeco (Fast Track 100 companies).

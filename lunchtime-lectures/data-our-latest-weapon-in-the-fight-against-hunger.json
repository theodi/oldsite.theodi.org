Can open data help us to understand the scale of the problem, and point the way to solutions or better targeting of resources?</p>\n<p>Simon Raper and Andy Hamflett will show how they aligned Trussell Trust client and food bank location data with a range of open datasets to create the UK’s first dynamic visualisation tool for food poverty. As well as mapping geographical demand, the prototype platform also aligns findings to 2011 Census data to predict where additional foodbanks may be needed.\nThe project – delivered alongside academics from Hull University Business School – presented the Trussell Trust with many new insights, and points to much greater strategic potential for a wider community of charities working to counter UK poverty.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/friday-lunchtime-lecture-data-our-latest-weapon-in-the-fight-against-hunger-tickets-25859284817\">Book now</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/51/57/5751570d1f986a5629000001/768fefdb-2929-4d1f-9754-6446833bbc61.png\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"5751570d1f986a1ff700000f\">\n<small>Screenshot of the Trussell Trust platform</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"aboutthespeakers\">About the speakers</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-raper-7812b45\">Simon Raper</a> from <a href=\"http://www.coppelia.io/\">Coppelia</a> is an RSS accredited statistician with over 15 years’ experience working in data mining and analytics and many more in coding and software development.

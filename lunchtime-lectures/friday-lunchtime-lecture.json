But how do they get started?</p>\n<p>In this lecture, Lucy Knight will share how her team at Devon County Council got to grips with open data through training, trying cheap tools and making critical friends. Lucy will explain how they created an environment where good data is valued as a resource and the goal is to make it as useful as possible with a 'fail fast, fail cheaply' attitude and rapid prototyping. Along with some of DCC's open data projects, Lucy will share some of the cultural and technical challenges they have met, and how they're overcoming them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"aboutthespeaker\">About the speaker</h3>\n<p>Lucy Knight is Data Lead for Devon County Council, co-founder of ODI Devon, and an ODI Training Associate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"livefeed\">Live feed</h3>\n<p>A live feed of this lunchtime lecture will be showing here from 1pm on Friday 31 March 2017.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YlJkoaCZSlM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","excerpt":"Friday lunchtime lectures at the Open Data Institute.

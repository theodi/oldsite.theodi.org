The Heritage + Culture Open Data Challenge invited people to use open data to create products or services that would engage more and more diverse people with UK heritage and culture.</p>\n<p>This lunchtime lecture we meet the three finalists: City Radar, Culture Everywhere and Rabble Days. They each gave a short pitch about their products, their development so far, how they are using open data to innovate and what their plans are for the future.</p>\n<p>Find out more about the challenge process <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/heritage-culture-open-data-challenge\">here</a>.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/261723372/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-m9yE798EsLMu8WbLzSIQ&show_recommendations=true\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.3323485967503692\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_18562\" width=\"600px\" height=\"400px\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\"></iframe>\n<iframe class=\"pull-right\" width=\"500px\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/200169354&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>","excerpt":"<img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/1c/fe/551cfe9df362be096b000042/HC-Logo.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img pull-right\" id=\"551cfe9d1f986a08f1000064\">\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: Using open data to help people engage with heritage and culture","end_date":"2015-04-10T12:50:00+00:00","location":"The Open Data Institute, 65 Clifton Street, London, EC2A 4JE","start_date":"2015-04-10T12:00:00+00:00","booking_url":"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/friday-lunchtime-lecture-our-heritage-culture-how-open-data-can-help-us-engage-tickets-16427697686","hashtag":"ODIFridays","event_type":"event:lunchtime-lecture","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/friday-lunchtime-lecture-whats-the-point-of-cultural-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures/friday-lunchtime-lecture-whats-the-point-of-cultural-open-data","slug":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-whats-the-point-of-cultural-open-data","title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: What's the point of cultural open data?","format":"event","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:54:33+00:00","created_at":"2013-10-23T16:48:29+00:00","tag_ids":["event:lunchtime-lecture"],"extras":{"start_date":"2013-11-29T13:00:00+00:00","end_date":"2013-11-29T13:45:00+00:00","location":"Open Data Institute, 65 Clifton Street, London, EC2A 4JE"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/friday-lunchtime-lecture-data-as-culture-2014.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures/friday-lunchtime-lecture-data-as-culture-2014","slug":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-data-as-culture-2014","title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: Data as Culture 2014","format":"event","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:55:22+00:00","created_at":"2014-04-01T16:58:04+00:00","tag_ids":["featured","event:lunchtime-lecture"],"extras":{"start_date":"2014-04-11T12:00:00+00:00","end_date":"2014-04-11T12:50:00+00:00","location":"Open Data Institute, 65 Clifton Street, London, EC2A 4JE"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-data-challenge-series-open-data-innovation-changing-communities-and-energy-usage-for-the-better.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures/open-data-challenge-series-open-data-innovation-changing-communities-and-energy-usage-for-the-better","slug":"open-data-challenge-series-open-data-innovation-changing-communities-and-energy-usage-for-the-better","title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: How the Open Data Challenge Series is creating community, energy & open data innovation","format":"event","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:55:44+00:00","created_at":"2014-05-15T10:11:44+00:00","tag_ids":["event:lunchtime-lecture"],"extras":{"start_date":"2014-05-23T12:00:00+00:00","end_date":"2014-05-23T12:50:00+00:00","location":"Open Data Institute, 65 Clifton Street, London, EC2A 4JE"}}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

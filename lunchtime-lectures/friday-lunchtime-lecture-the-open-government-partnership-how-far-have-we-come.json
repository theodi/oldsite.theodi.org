G8 leaders signed the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-data-charter/g8-open-data-charter-and-technical-annex\" title=\"Gov.uk\">Open Data Charter</a> and the UK Government made a series 21 commitments in a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/255901/ogp_uknationalactionplan.pdf\" title=\"Gov.uk\">National Action Plan</a> for open government. It pledged to release more local open data, manage digital records better and develop a new anti-corruption strategy, among other initiatives to help it transition to ‘open by default’. </p>\n<p>How far have they been met, two years on? Politics expert Ben Worthy will reflect on findings from his new independent report on the action plan, followed by comments from Involve and the Cabinet Office.</p>\n<p><em>Ben Worthy is a lecturer in politics at Birkbeck College, University of London where he teaches Contemporary British Politics and Digital Politics. He has written extensively on issues around transparency, freedom of information and open data, looking particularly at the impact of the UK Government’s Transparency Agenda.</em> </p>\n<iframe style=\"float:left; max-width:100%;\" width=\"600px\" height=\"500px\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/284174845/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-3fIjjbSHnJfLyOnjSTHs&amp;show_recommendations=true\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.7790927021696252\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_98477\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tjOPNPeQJ1E\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","excerpt":"You bring your lunch, we provide tea and coffee, an interesting talk, and enough time to get back to your desk.\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: The Open Government Partnership: how far have we come?","end_date":"2015-09-25T12:50:00+00:00","location":"Open Data Institute, 65 Clifton Street","start_date":"2015-09-25T12:00:00+00:00","booking_url":"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/friday-lunchtime-lecture-the-open-government-partnership-how-far-have-we-come-tickets-18452297318","hashtag":"","event_type":"event:lunchtime-lecture","organizations":[],"author":{}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/friday-lunchtime-lecture-open-government-open-cities-open-companies-how-open-data-is-changing-the-game-everywhere.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures/friday-lunchtime-lecture-open-government-open-cities-open-companies-how-open-data-is-changing-the-game-everywhere","slug":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-open-government-open-cities-open-companies-how-open-data-is-changing-the-game-everywhere","title":" Friday lunchtime lecture: Open innovation: how open data is changing the game everywhere","format":"event","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:58:56+00:00","created_at":"2015-01-28T09:29:01+00:00","tag_ids":["odifridays-lunchtime","startup","opendatasoft","smart-cities","event:lunchtime-lecture"],"extras":{"start_date":"2015-02-13T13:00:00+00:00","end_date":"2015-02-13T13:50:00+00:00","location":"The Open Data Institute, 65 Clifton Street, London, EC2A 4JE"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/friday-lunchtime-lecture-how-open-data-can-help-charities-and-grant-funders-focus-resources.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures/friday-lunchtime-lecture-how-open-data-can-help-charities-and-grant-funders-focus-resources","slug":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-how-open-data-can-help-charities-and-grant-funders-focus-resources","title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: How open data can help charities and grant funders focus resources","format":"event","updated_at":"2015-11-05T14:28:53+00:00","created_at":"2015-08-24T08:17:39+00:00","tag_ids":["event:lunchtime-lecture","odifridays","nesta","360-giving","charities","ngo","event"],"extras":{"start_date":"2015-09-11T12:00:00+00:00","end_date":"2015-09-11T12:50:00+00:00","location":"Open Data Institute, 65 Clifton Street"}}],"organizations":[],"author":{}}

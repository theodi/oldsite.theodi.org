Its vision is that UK grantmaking is more informed, effective and strategic.</p>\n<p>360Giving supports organisations to publish their grants data in an open, standardised way and helps people to understand and use the data in order to support decision-making and learning across the charitable giving sector. They’ve developed an open data standard as part of their work – <a href=\"http://www.threesixtygiving.org/standard/\">the 360Giving Standard</a> – and already some of the largest UK grantmakers are using it to share information about thousands of grants worth billions of pounds.</p>\n<p>360Giving is also supporting the development of tools and platforms that allow easy access and use of the data, including <a href=\"http://www.beehivegiving.org/welcome\">Beehive Giving</a> and <a href=\"http://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/\">GrantNav</a>. As the dataset grows, they’re starting to test its usefulness via a series of data use pilots, starting in Manchester.</p>\n<p>This lunchtime lecture will focus on 360’s progress so far, including challenges and lessons learned. The 360Giving team is also interested to hear from ODI staff about implementing behaviour change within organisations based on better access to information and open data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"aboutthespeakers\">About the speakers</h3>\n<p><strong>Rachel Rank</strong> is Chief Executive of 360Giving.

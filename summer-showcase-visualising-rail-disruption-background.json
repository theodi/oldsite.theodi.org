While city planners and local authorities work hard to future-proof infrastructure against the needs of a growing population – by developing transport services, for example – plans may take years to come into effect. Better use of open data can provide insights to help the public to find more efficient ways of using services already in operation.</b></p>\n    <p>On average, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2614573/A-year-life-wasted-commuting-Average-worker-pays-50-000-privilege.html\" title=\"Daily Mail Article - Londoners time spent commuting\">a Londoner spends 18 months of their life travelling to and from work</a>. For those whose commute involves multiple means of transport, a delay at any stage could potentially be amplified as the journey progresses. Imagine, then, if a commuter had access to information that indicated that taking a more reliable train 10 minutes earlier than usual could get them to their destination in less time. Any onward journey may also be completed in shorter time: commuters would be more likely to catch connecting services by rail or bus. By arriving to work in less time, they would be able to leave earlier, and potentially avoid further delays on their way home. Aside from simply experiencing less frustration, our commuter could have more time to read a bedtime story to their children.</p> \n\n    <p>Another commuter may be travelling by train to a job interview or an important meeting in a town or city that they don’t typically visit. If this person could find out how consistent and punctual certain trains were likely to be, they would be able to judge how much time to leave spare in case of delays.</p>\n\n    <p>For most commuters, rail travel is a means to an end. They want to find the fastest, most efficient route from A to B. Users of the <a href=\"http://delayexplorer.fasteroute.com\" title=\"Visualising Rail Disruption\">Visualising Rail Disruption</a> web application, and the smartphone app <a href=\"http://fasteroute.com\">Fasteroute</a>, can save significant amounts of time by exploring potential routes and planning journeys using services that are more reliable, avoiding risky connections that could be missed due to trains that are often delayed.</p>\n  <p><blockquote>There are many apps and tools that use real-time open data to help commuters find the best immediate route to a destination, such as the National Rail Enquiries app or CityMapper. But until now, commuters have been unable to easily evaluate how reliable an individual service is by using a train’s historical record of punctuality.</blockquote></p>\n    <p>— George Goldberg, Fasteroute developer and Project Manager of Visualising Rail Disruption</p>\n\n    <p>The Visualising Rail Disruption application provides useful visual information about the reliability of train services through a chosen station. It provides valuable information to people, such as potential house buyers or renters who may be searching for a home with access to well-connected, reliable rail links. House price websites already provide information about the nearest transport links and schools around a prospective property. Knowing whether transport links are reliable before making a large investment in an area can prevent these potential commuters losing minutes or hours every week due to rail delays and cancellations.</p>\n\n    <p><blockquote>Since the project began, we have worked to improve access to the aggregated data, adding an indicator of reliability into our mobile application <a href=\"http://get.fasteroute.com\">Fasteroute</a>. Users can see at-a-glance which trains are reliably on time and which are not when looking at the departure board through the traffic-lights coloured indicators. When looking at the service details, they can see an explanation of the traffic light colour indicated for that train.</blockquote></p>\n    <p>— George Goldberg, Fasteroute developer and Project Manager of Visualising Rail Disruption</p>\n    <p></p>\n\n    <div>\n      <a href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-visualising-rail-disruption-about-the-data\" title=\"Next page\"><img class=\"pull-right\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/16/43/56164300f362be08b400000f/summer_showcase_next_but.svg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n      <a href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-visualising-rail-disruption\" title=\"Previous page\"><img class=\"pull-left\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/29/f4/5629f4fe1f986a081e000033/previous.svg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n    </div>\n\n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"pull-left col-md-3\">\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-visualising-rail-disruption\">About</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box-opacity\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-visualising-rail-disruption-background\">Background</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-visualising-rail-disruption-about-the-data\">About the data</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-visualising-rail-disruption-methodology\">Methodology</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-visualising-rail-disruption-collaboration\">Findings</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-visualising-rail-disruption-what-next\">What next?</a>\n    </div>\n\n  </div>\n</div>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

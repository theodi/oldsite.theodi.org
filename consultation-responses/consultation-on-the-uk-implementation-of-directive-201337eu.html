<h2>Consultation on the UK implementation of Directive 2013/37/EU</h2>
<h3 id="executivesummary">Executive summary:</h3>
<p>The Open Data Institute <strong>(ODI)</strong> thanks The National Archives for the opportunity to comment on the UK Government&#8217;s proposed implementation of the amended EU Directive on the re-use of public sector information (Directive 2013/37/EU) **(PSI Directive). **The ODI is joined in making this submission by <a href="https://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge</a>, <a href="http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/">KnowWhere Consulting</a>, <a href="http://www.siriusopensource.com/">Sirius Corporation Ltd</a> and <a href="http://www.logicalspark.com/">LogicalSpark Limited</a>. </p>
<p>The UK has been a world leader in supporting and encouraging the re-use of public sector information. The Office of Public Sector Information <strong>(OPSI)</strong> has played an important role in this, overseeing the introduction of the Open Government Licence, the Information Fair Trader Scheme and exceptions to marginal cost pricing, as well as mediation and redress mechanisms for complaints. </p>
<p>The ODI is concerned, however, that the UK Government&#8217;s proposed implementation of the 2013 PSI Directive is a backwards step. It is out of sync with existing initiatives introduced by OPSI as well as the prevailing Open Data policy led by the Cabinet Office. It is disproportionately focused on reducing burdens on the public sector, rather than facilitating an optimal environment for re-use. The ODI fears this approach loses sight of broader policy objectives in opening up public data: encouraging economic growth, enhancing government transparency and accountability and uncovering new social and environmental benefits. </p>
<h3 id="article4redress">Article 4: Redress</h3>
<p>The ODI supports the aim of the Government&#8217;s proposed redress mechanism: to ensure that decisions on complaints about the re-use of public information are legally binding. However, the ODI remains concerned the bulk of proposed costs and risk of seeking this means of redress from a tribunal will be met by re-users.</p>
<h3 id="article6chargingoptions">Article 6: Charging options</h3>
<p>The ODI is concerned by a lack of clarity regarding charges for re-use of some (exempted) public information. It does not define how exemptions for certain public sector bodies are to be granted, and how the additional charges set by these exempted bodies are to be calculated. The proposed implementation seems to reverse existing structures in place for exceptions to marginal cost pricing, which are strictly applied before a public body is able to apply charges. The proposed changes could facilitate greater charging for re-use of public information in the UK than is currently permitted. </p>
<h3 id="abouttheorganisations">About the organisations</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>I support this submission from the ODI. If the proposed changes were to go forward unamended they would, in my opinion, further shift the balance in favour of PSI holders and away from businesses and individuals seeking to make use of PSI. This would be a retrograde step and would conflict with our government&#8217;s Open Data and Transparency agendas."*</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sirius highly commends, and supports, the incredible progress of the UK Government in Openness these past few years, going from outlier to world leader. We are therefore deeply concerned that this current proposal is a backward step, will undo much good work and more goodwill, due to its focus on reducing administrative burden at the expense of the principles of openness that you have otherwise done so much to advance."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="article4redress-1">Article 4: Redress</h3>
<p><strong>Proposal:</strong></p>
<p>That the existing investigative body (OPSI) be retained, with referral to a First-tier Tribunal such as the Information Rights jurisdiction, for a legally binding decision.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong></p>
<p>Empower an existing regulator to make legally binding decisions with appeal to a First-tier Tribunal. <strong>The ODI believes the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office is best placed to exercise this role. This will reduce cost and efficiency burdens for both re-users and public sector bodies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 1</strong></p>
<p>Do you agree that this represents the most appropriate way to deliver the means of redress required by the amending Directive? If you do not agree, what do you think would be suitable alternative and why?</p>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how the proposed referral of decisions to a First-tier tribunal will interact with existing redress processes. There are currently three stages of the OPSI complaints process:</p>
<p><strong>Stage One:</strong> Resolution with originating public sector body</p>
<p><strong>Stage Two:</strong> Appeal to the Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI)</p>
<p><strong>Stage Three:</strong> Appeal to the Advisory Panel on Public Sector Information (APPSI)</p>
<p>Would the First-tier tribunal be a fourth stage in the complaints process? Or would it replace stage three? The Impact Assessment indicates that re-users or public bodies could appeal to the First-tier tribunal if they are unhappy with a (non-binding) recommendation from OPSI. The ODI is concerned that there is no enforcement mechanism if OPSI recommendations are in favour of the complainant. We are also concerned that an additional tribunal stage on top of the existing complaints process will result in delays and increased costs for both the public sector bodies and re-users involved, and act as a chilling factor on re-use. The worst outcome of an amendment to the existing redress mechanism in the UK would be one that suppresses potentially innovative new uses of public data. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/opsi-complaints-process-audit-report.pdf">last audit</a> of the OPSI complaints process undertaken by APPSI panel member Phillip Webb in 2011 indicated that the time frame for resolution of complaints [as of 2011] varied between 1 to 325 days. <em>(NOTE: http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/opsi-complaints-process-audit-report.pdf p8)</em> 64% of complaints to OPSI were resolved within 7.4 days, with 36% moving on through the full complaints process. <em>(NOTE: ibid.)</em> With one third of complaints seemingly requiring protracted resolution, the ODI fears that a lengthy and ultimately non-binding process with OPSI will discourage re-use of public-sector information. </p>
<p>Since its amalgamation with The National Archives, the identity and visibility of OPSI has been obscured. In his 2011 audit of the OPSI complaint process, Webb recommended that clear statements be provided on The National Archives site and in other relevant places on legislation.gov.uk establishing the status of OPSI and its relationship with The National Archives <em>(Recommendation 3)</em>. <em>(NOTE: Above n 2, 7.)</em> Today, The National Archives website still does not clearly establish its relationship with OPSI, which can be confusing for re-users trying to exercise their redress abilities under the Regulations. OPSI is similarly invisible on GOV.UK. The National Archives is a major information holder in its own right, which can be perceived to be a source of conflict for OPSI exercising its complaints resolution role. To continue to occupy this role, safeguards must be put in place to ensure OPSI's responsibilities are not obscured by any conflict of interest with TNA. </p>
<p>The ODI believes the best way of implementing the amended PSI Directive is to provide an independent regulator with power in legislation to enforce decisions on the re-use of public sector information, just as there are for decisions related to Freedom of Information requests. As APPSI said in their response to the PSI Directive Consultation <em>(NOTE: http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/APPSI-PSI-Directive-Consultation-Response-2010.pdf )</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"one of the problems experienced by private companies is the absence of real sanctions that could be applied in cases where PSBs [public sector bodies] are non-compliant".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office, the established independent authority whose mission is to uphold information rights in the public interest, <em>(NOTE: http://ico.org.uk/what<em>we</em>cover)</em> is well placed to do this. ICO already rules on complaints under the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000, among other areas of legislation. This would align the regulatory regime for re-use of information with the regime for access, which is particularly relevant since the "Right to Data" was introduced in the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012. </p>
<p>While ICO lacks experience with regulating PSI re-use, the recent review by APPSI following a complaint about OPSI by 77M <em>(NOTE: https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/appsi-review-board-report-77m-september-2014.pdf)</em> highlights the fact that OPSI lacks the necessary technical expertise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Board acknowledges OPSI&#8217;s long history of furthering the cause of re-use of Public Sector Information. However some of the issues that are now being encountered (as evidenced in this report) are increasingly technical, even arcane and vary from one data domain to another. For this reason we urge OPSI to draw upon external experts on a contracted basis to provide the necessary detailed technical knowledge, background and other expertise not readily available from OPSI&#8217;s internal resources. The Board Recommends that OPSI establishes a contracted panel of external business and technical experts on which it can readily call for assistance when addressing these more complex commercial and technical issues. This might operate by employing a model similar to that used by the Cabinet Office for Major Project and Gateway Reviews.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ODI notes the consideration of this option in the Consultation (Option C) and concerns regarding possible devolution of complaints related to Scottish public sector bodies being routed through the Scottish Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office. The ODI has confidence in the ability of Scotland&#8217;s Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office to work with the ICO, with both authorities sharing the same mission: to uphold information rights in the public interest. </p>
<p><strong>For these reasons, the ODI believes the Information Commissioner's Office is best placed to rule on and enforce decisions regarding re-use of public sector information. Regardless of which body regulates in this area, it needs to have the power to make binding decisions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 2</strong></p>
<p>Do you consider that the First-tier Tribunal is the appropriate body to hear and determine appeals against decisions made under the amending Directive?</p>
<p><strong>Yes.</strong> </p>
<p>However, the ODI is concerned that the length and complexity of First-tier Tribunal proceedings will be a barrier to uptake by re-users. </p>
<p>There appear to be fees implied in the Tribunal route to be borne by the complainant, as well as potential additional costs: a First-tier Tribunal has the power to award costs against claims deemed unreasonable, *(NOTE: Rule no 10, Orders for Costs, http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/tribunals/general/consolidated-TPFTT-GRC-Rules2009-6-04-12.pdf) which will further deter pursuit of this appeal option unless "unreasonable" is clearly and simply defined. </p>
<p>If a First-tier Tribunal is the desired body, its implementation should reflect the objective of the amending PSI Directive: to encourage re-use of public information. To best do this, the ODI believes there should be no fees for complainants to use the Tribunal. An award of costs against public sector bodies in the event of a successful appeal may also stimulate greater release of information in the first place, and reduce the need for Tribunal proceedings. </p>
<p>Further, the ODI believes that appeals to a First-tier Tribunal should be minimised through ensuring that it is possible for a complainant to get a legally binding decision earlier in the process, as described in our answer to Question 1.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3</strong> </p>
<p>Do you consider that the General Regulatory Chamber Rules of the First-tier Tribunal will suit the handling of these appeals? The General Regulatory Chamber Rules may be found at: <strong><a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/tribunals/rules">http://www.justice.gov.uk/tribunals/rules</a></strong></p>
<p>The ODI&#8217;s first preference is for an independent authority with an existing investigative function who can hear complaints on re-use and make binding decisions. The ICO already exercises this function for complaints under the FOI regime, and is well placed to exercise a similar function for complaints on re-use. Relevant resources from OPSI could be transferred to the ICO to assist with this function and/or ICO could draw on an external panel of experts, as APPSI recommended that OPSI do <em>(see our response to Question 1 above)</em>. </p>
<p>In the event an existing regulator like ICO is not utilised, the General Regulatory Chamber Rules (GRCR) must be adjusted or wielded in a way that does not impose cost or administrative burdens on complainants, which can be easily followed and which facilitate timely decision making. </p>
<p>Otherwise, the GRCR appear too long and complex for the complaints process. They will particularly deter appeal by individuals, start-ups and SMEs who have limited access to legal advice: exactly the groups who are intended to be the main beneficiaries of PSI available at marginal cost. </p>
<hr>
<h3 id="article6chargingoptions-1">Article 6: Charging options</h3>
<p><strong>Proposal:</strong> </p>
<p>That where charges above marginal costs are made, such charges should should be calculated according to objective, transparent and verifiable criteria in UK legislation. The total charge should not exceed the cost of collection, production, reproduction and dissemination together with a reasonable return on investment.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> </p>
<p>That the Government (a) clarify the calculation by which above marginal costs will be determined, and (b) how this will interact with existing processes for above marginal costs charging under the Government Licensing Framework.</p>
<p><strong>Question 4</strong> </p>
<p>Do you have any comments about the proposed approach to laying down criteria for the calculation of charges in cases where charges above marginal cost are made?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear to the ODI exactly what criteria the Government is proposing to introduce for the calculation of charges above marginal cost. Is the criteria to be, "costs not exceeding the cost of collection, production, reproduction and dissemination together with a reasonable return on investment"? The ODI fears such general criteria will enable greater charging for public sector information than is currently permitted. This is directly contrary to the stated aim of the amended PSI Directive: to stimulate greater release and re-use of public sector information. </p>
<p>The existing <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/criteria-exceptions-marginal-cost-pricing.pdf">Government Licensing Framework</a> sets out 19 rigorous criteria, including 5 mandatory criteria for above marginal costs charging. <em>(NOTE: http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/criteria-exceptions-marginal-cost-pricing.pdf)</em> Public bodies wishing to charge above marginal costs <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/exception-to-marginal-cost-pricing-application-guidelines.pdf">must apply to OPSI for an exemption</a> on a case by case basis and demonstrate that they meet these criteria. <em>(NOTE: http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/exception-to-marginal-cost-pricing-application-guidelines.pdf)</em> Some public bodies can seek accreditation from OPSI to be excluded from this case-by-case criteria under the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/ifts-and-regulation/ifts-verification-process/">Information Fair Trader Scheme</a>. <em>(NOTE: http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/ifts-and-regulation/ifts-verification-process/)</em> Again, there are strict requirements for a public body to be registered under the IFTS. </p>
<p>The existing framework is not perfect. The list of <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/ifts-and-regulation/ifts-members/">registered IFTS members</a> <em>(NOTE: http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/ifts-and-regulation/ifts-members/)</em> (who can charge above marginal cost recovery) includes public bodies with stewardship of core reference datasets - like the Met Office, Ordnance Survey and Land Registry - which hold significant potential if released as open data. The Public Administration Committee (PASC) report on <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-administration-select-committee/news/statistics-and-open-data-response/">Statistics and Open Data</a>, <em>(NOTE: http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-administration-select-committee/news/statistics-and-open-data-response/)</em> released in March 2014, highlights the need for a "radical new approach to the funding of government open data":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A modest part of the cost to the public of statutory registrations should be earmarked for ensuring that the resultant data - suitably anonymised if necessary - can become open data. Data held by the Land Registry and car registration data held by DVLA and, indeed, Care.data held by the NHS are among relevant examples." (paragraph 75)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In July 2014, the European Commission published its guidelines on recommended standard licences, datasets and charging for the reuse of documents (<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/commission-notice-guidelines-recommended-standard-licences-datasets-and-charging-re-use">2014/C 240/01</a>), to assist EU Member States implementing the amended PSI Directive. It sets out explicit criteria to guide charging, that should be taken into account by the UK. </p>
<p>Regarding transparency, the EU guidelines encourage public bodies to publish the amounts of revenue received through charging for the re-use of the information they hold (4.3). In their submission to this consultation, the Open Data User Group (ODUG) emphasises the need for greater transparency around additional charges, including for implementing any charging regime. The ODI believes that the publication of the kind of information considered by ODUG, as well as information regarding charging revenue, should be a requirement for public bodies seeking to charge above marginal cost under the UK&#8217;s amended Regulations. </p>
<p>UK implementation of the PSI Directive should build on the recommendations contained in PASC&#8217;s 2014 report, and existing mechanisms in place. At the very least, it could enshrine existing mechanisms in the Regulations, to require approval from OPSI before a public body is able to charge for re-use above marginal cost. It should require the publication of information about costs, including the revenue received from above marginal cost pricing, the costs of implementing charges and from maintaining the data asset, for public bodies seeking to charge above marginal cost. Instead, the ODI fears that the UK&#8217;s proposed implementation will be a backwards step.</p>
<h3 id="question5">Question 5</h3>
<p>With reference to the Impact Assessment, are there any other impacts, benefits or implications of the proposals which should be considered?</p>
<p>The Impact Assessment currently sets very low expectations of how many people will seek appeal of re-use decisions, and how much the tribunal process will cost. If the proposed charging criteria results in greater charging for re-use of information, then this could result in more appeals. Alternatively, increased costs combined with the complexity of the proposed tribunal appeal process could put people off appealing re-use decisions altogether. This would be the worst outcome, and furthest from the aims of the PSI Directive. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/impact-assessment.pdf">Impact Assessment assumes</a> there will be no change in the volume of complaints and that a tribunal will require 7.7 days of panel sitting time. <em>(NOTE: http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/impact-assessment.pdf p2)</em> Their assumptions seem to be based on Webb&#8217;s 2011 audit report of OPSI complaints, and don&#8217;t take into account the potential for increased appeals if the proposed amendments allow more public sector charging for information. </p>
<p>They also incorrectly estimate the time costs of a tribunal hearing. Webb&#8217;s 2011 audit of the OPSI complaints process indicated that while 64% of complaints were resolved by OPSI within 7.4 days, these were <em>prior to moving through the full complaints process.</em> <em>(NOTE: above n2.)</em> The one third of complaints that did move through formal OPSI processes could take up to 325 days to reach a recommendation. The Impact Assessment contemplates redress to a tribunal being available <em>after</em> OPSI has made its recommendation, which will add further delays to the process. <em>(NOTE: Paragraph 5.6, above n. 11.)</em></p>
<p>The Impact Assessment should take into account the potential impact of changes to existing cost charging criteria (if this is proposed), and potential increased likelihood of appeals as a result. </p>
<h3 id="othercomments">Other comments</h3>
<p>The National Archives should publish a draft of the regulations prior to implementation. It&#8217;s unclear from this Consultation exactly how the UK is intending to update its existing Regulations. The ODI looks forward to an opportunity to review the proposed regulations. </p>
<p>The consultation document also indicates there may be a need for amendment to the provisions on the release and re-use of requested datasets under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) as amended by section 102 of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012. Is The National Archives able to give any indication as to when a consultation on this process will take place? The ODI would be glad to contribute to this. </p>

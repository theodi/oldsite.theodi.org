<h2>Independent Public Sector Information Review</h2>
<p>Issues of fairness, openness and quality dominated a session on the economic value of open data at the ODI. Head of an independent review of public sector information, Stephan Shakespeare was joined by more than 40 CEOs, government officials and geeks on Monday 18<sup>th</sup> March 2013for &#8220;Open Data Market Makers&#8221;*.</p>
<p>The event started with presentations by three start-up businesses that are currently building products, services and revenues from open data. <a href="../case-study/mastodon-c">Mastodon C</a>, <a href="../case-study/placr">Placr</a> and <a href="../case-study/opencorporates">Open Corporates</a> are all based at the ODI, working with big data, transport data and company data respectively.</p>
<p>ODI CEO, Gavin Starks said that the three were examples of great new companies emerging from the open data market. In an anecdote, an angel investor in one of the companies likened the ODI to a swimming coach he met 25 years ago. The coach said that he was &#8220;not trying to create a champion&#8221; but an environment in which &#8220;champions are inevitable&#8221;.</p>
<p>Framing the session, Stephan Shakespeare said he is interested in two main things: what should be in a national strategy for data ? and; what can be done to maximise the economic benefits ?</p>
<h2 id="keythemes">Key themes</h2>
<p>The debate was chaired by the ODI&#8217;s Commercial Director, Stuart Coleman and a number of themes emerged:</p>
<ul>
<li>**<a href="#fairness">Fairness</a>: **the need to develop a level playing field between government and the private sector.</li>
<li>**<a href="#rules">Rules &amp; regulations</a>: **how to make more data available and the role of legislation.</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="#opportunities">Opportunities for businesses</a>:</strong> what established businesses can gain from open data.</li>
<li>**<a href="#privacy">Privacy</a>: **misconceptions about open data vs personal data.</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="#consistency">Consistency and quality</a>:</strong> the idea of opening data first and cleaning it up later.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fairness">Fairness</h2>
<p>Several attendees made the point that when &#8220;government turns developer&#8221; there can be problems for private sector companies hoping to build businesses on public sector data. One private sector delegate said that his company had been working on a product using government data whilst unbeknownst to him, government was doing the same thing itself. The work cost his organisation a lot of money, which could have been avoided if government was more transparent about the work it was already doing.</p>
<p>Others claimed that the key issue is to ensure equality by giving private sector developers access to data at the same time as it begins to be used internally. In fact, said one CEO, as soon as officials decide to build something using their data, it should be released externally.</p>
<p>There are huge differences in the amount and quality of the data that is openly available in different sectors, according to a number of attendees. Transport data, said one, is being released in vast quantities and &#8220;everyone is playing with it&#8221;. The same is not true of health, crime and justice data.</p>
<h2 id="rulesregulations">Rules &amp; regulations</h2>
<p>There was a discussion about the data that government has monetised through its trading funds. One audience member said that there can be a feeling amongst officials that these revenues must be protected. However, there is probably a great deal more value to be realised from releasing the data openly.</p>
<p>The same person went on to describe the ODI as &#8220;an island of hope in a sea of despair&#8221;. There are very few sanctions available against government bodies that refuse to share their data, he added. Unlike the Freedom of Information Act, there is nothing that requires officials to explain why they will not make data openly available. This was a recurrent theme throughout the session and something which audience members agreed needs addressing. Some spoke in favour or legislation, others for clear, unambiguous guidelines, stopping short of legislation.</p>
<p>The audience&#8217;s comments received a sympathetic response from Stephan Shakespeare. He said that his first recommendation will look at clarifying how people can get hold of public sector data and under what circumstances requests can be turned down.</p>
<h2 id="opportunitiesforbusiness">Opportunities for business</h2>
<p>Two large organisations that are using open data to develop products and services for their customers spoke about the opportunities presented by the emerging market. &#8220;It feels like the rebirth of the internet&#8221; said one, adding that he relishes the chance to bring open data to the consumer world.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that there is some nervousness around open data (in particular where people confuse it with personal data), he added that he is seeking to reassure his customers that their privacy will not be compromised. He rounded up that there are opportunities for those companies that embrace open data to &#8220;get a head start&#8221; on others.</p>
<p>Another organisation using open data said that they wanted to be a catalyst for transforming the use of open data to enhance public services to benefit peoples&#8217; lives.</p>
<h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>
<p>Picking up on points about privacy and data protection, one CEO said that the Shakespeare review should also focus on education. Open data and personal data can get conflated in peoples&#8217; minds and this needs to be addressed if the opportunities are to be fully realised.</p>
<p>The ODI&#8217;s Gavin Starks added that this is one area where the Institute is working hard to build understanding through its training programmes, guides and face-to-face work with businesses and organisations.</p>
<h2 id="consistencyandquality">Consistency and quality</h2>
<p>One venture capitalist in the audience remarked that getting data published is not an easy process and that it would be wrong to expect perfection. Sometimes, he added, it should be enough for the data to be &#8220;fit for purpose&#8221;, although the definition of that term is debateable in itself.</p>
<p>Another attendee remarked that &#8220;perfect is the enemy of good enough&#8221; whilst Gavin Starks added that once the data becomes open, you can &#8220;start throwing start-ups at it to help clean up the data&#8221;.</p>
<p>Stephan Shakespeare added that he will be recommending a National Core Data Set of clean, useable data for certain datasets. However, this won&#8217;t mean that other data can&#8217;t be published. One of the key areas he is exploring is how much we should insist that data meets certain standards and whether it is acceptable to have two levels of data: some raw and dirty and; some clean.</p>
<hr>
<p>The views and opinions gathered at the event will inform the Shakespeare Review and the ODI is looking at creating further events to explore the issues. Feedback from the session included a chorus of voices asking the ODI to do &#8220;more of the same&#8221;.</p>

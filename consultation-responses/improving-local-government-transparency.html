<h2>Improving local government transparency</h2>
<p><strong>Question 1: What amendments or additions could be made to paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Code to aid compliance?</strong></p>
<p>Paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Code address the creation and maintenance of an inventory of public data by each local authority.</p>
<p>In our experience, inventories and lists of datasets are hard and time-consuming to create, costly to maintain, and tend to get out of date. From a reusers perspective, a large, unfocused, out-of-date inventory, particularly of datasets that they cannot actually access without going through a Freedom of Information process, is more frustrating than helpful. It is therefore important to balance the cost of creating and maintaining such a list with the benefits that it provides to potential reusers.</p>
<p>There are three lists of datasets that should be maintained by a local authority:</p>
<ul>
<li>An internal list of their information assets, which should be maintained and reviewed as part of their information asset risk management, on a business-as-usual basis. The review of information assets should include their suitability as a source for published datasets, in particular taking into account the source of the data and whether the local authority has the right to republish or derive data from it. Often the published datasets will be extracts or summaries of the data held within a particular information asset.</li>
<li>A list of published datasets; if a local authority registers these datasets on data.gov.uk, such a list can be generated automatically and does not require additional work by the local authority. For the purposes of <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1515/regulation/16/made">Regulation 16 of the Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations</a>, this is also &#8220;a list of main documents available for re-use&#8221;.</li>
<li>A prioritised inventory of candidate datasets for publication, alongside indicative dates of planned publication. This list should include datasets that the authority aspires to publish in future, even if there is no date for publication, as this will help assess demand. Information previously requested under Freedom of Information or through the data request process managed by the Open Data User Group is a good candidate for proactive publication as open data.</li>
</ul>
<p>When considering the publication of datasets in the second and third lists described above, local authorities are already obliged to publish their publication scheme, which lists the classes of information that they are making available. Local authorities should consider where they hold structured data for each class of information in the publicationscheme as a means of identifying potentially useful datasets for publication.</p>
<p>To aid the location of published data, we would also encourage local authorities to register the datasets they do publish on data.gov.uk and to embed links and pointers to these datasets from suitable places within the local authority website. For example, data about taxi licences should be made available from the web pages about taxi licences; data about recycling facilities should be made available from the web pages about recycling facilities.</p>
<p>If the Code includes a requirement for local authorities to publish an inventory of unpublished datasets, we think that it should be specific about what information is required within the inventory. If it is not, we find that different organisations tend to make different judgement calls about what should be included, supply it in different formats and provide data that cannot be compared across organisations. We also note that local authorities hold a potentially unlimited supply of datasets, corresponding to different extracts from their information assets, and listing all of them is both infeasible and unhelpful.</p>
<p>For these reasons, we believe that it would be useful to in addition provide within the Code:</p>
<ul>
<li>a definition of &#8220;dataset&#8221; that would enable local authorities to assess what should be listed within the inventory (eg &#8220;the highest value spreadsheets, databases and data-holding documents maintained by the local authority whose contents &#8212; redacted, anonymised or aggregated as necessary &#8212; would be made available under a Freedom of Information request&#8221;)</li>
<li>a definition of how the inventory itself should be published (eg as an CSV spreadsheet, rather than as a PDF document) and that the inventory should be registered on data.gov.uk to ensure that it is discoverable as well as accessible</li>
<li>a description of what information should be included within the inventory about each dataset (eg the same minimal information required for registering that dataset on data.gov.uk)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 2: What data streams could be added to the Code to aid transparency where services are contracted-out; and help greater access to contract information?</strong></p>
<p>Local authorities should ensure that when services are contracted out, they are granted the rights to all the data that is created as a result of providing the service. This ensures that the local authority is able to reuse the data themselves, as well as preventing them from being locked in to a particular service provider. Publishing this data will aid competition between suppliers when contracts are next procured. Good suppliers should be enthusiastic to show the world how well they are delivering services through the publication of performance data.</p>
<p>We would also suggest adding a requirement that the service provider publish as open data any non-personal performance information that is related to the contracted-out service and is required under the contract to be reported back to the local authority.</p>
<p>This will help reduce the overhead on both sides of the contract as the local authority can access the performance information that it needs in a flexible way. It will help make sure that that those public services delivered under contract enable growth and accountability through data reuse in the same way as other services.</p>
<p>When services are contracted out, we would also encourage local authorities to publish the contracts themselves in a structured form (such that each clause is addressable on the web), as open data. This enables third parties who are dependent on the service to understand the agreement that has been made between the local authority and the service provider, and therefore what service they should expect, and to alert the local authority if the agreement is breached.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3: Are there other data sets which would be useful to the public which could be added to paragraph 12 of the Code? In particular, is there any data that would:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and local businesses</strong></li>
<li><strong>Support the release of surplus Local Authority land and property?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The datasets that are proposed within paragraph 12 of the Code enable transparency but are not datasets on which local businesses can be built. The following datasets, held by local authorities, would enable the creation of tools and businesses that might improve public services for the citizen:</p>
<ul>
<li>records of licences issued (and those refused) for different services provided in the area would enable the creation of applications to locate those services, as well as to check whether an organisation or individual is licensed for that service and to alert licensees about requirements to renew their licence</li>
<li>school catchment areas and/or selection policies would enable tools to be built that helped parents to choose where to live</li>
<li>information about parking spaces, for both cars and bikes, including their location, restrictions, charging and utilisation, would aid the creation of applications that helped citizens choose where to park, as well as planning for additional parking spaces</li>
<li>data about the creation of new roads, changes to street names, and about the boundaries and locations of points of interest within the local authority area would help the maintenance of maps, including open maps provided by OpenStreetMap</li>
<li>planning information that describes new developments and extensions would enable the creation of alerting tools that help citizens understand planned developments in their area</li>
<li>detailed information about bus stops, including whether they have shelters, seats and other accessibility features, would help the tailoring of transport applications for those people with impaired mobility</li>
<li>engineering logs that detail faults fixed and who performed the work would enable the creation of tools that rate particular engineers and subcontractors (and help the local authority select those who perform better) and would help those moving into an area or a particular property to understand what maintenance has been carried out; it would also enable new entrants to identify where underperforming contractors could be supplanted by a better service</li>
<li>lists of empty buildings would help property developers to identify properties that they could potentially purchase and develop</li>
</ul>
<p>In cases where datasets cannot be released under the Open Government Licence (for example due to being Ordnance Survey derived data), we would encourage the publication of the dataset excluding that derived data, rather than entirely excluding its publication. If the data is published without these fields, it is possible that the excluded data can be derived from other sources (such as OpenStreetMap or through crowd-sourcing) that do not have the same restrictions, and therefore that reusers can benefit from the data that can be released.</p>
<p><strong>Question 4: Is the description of minimum standards and proposed timing to achieve them correct?</strong></p>
<p>The sustainability of data publication is all important for those who build services on top of that data. So long as it is machine-readable (2-star) and openly licensed (as described in paragraph 14), the frequency, consistency and accuracy of the publication of a dataset is more important than the format in which it is published. We would therefore suggest adding recommendations to the Code that require local authorities</p>
<ul>
<li>to make the publication of open data sustainable by incorporating it into existing processes and workflows</li>
<li>to publish metadata about each dataset that include information about the frequency with which it will be refreshed and provide mechanisms to inform reusers about those updates</li>
<li>to consider the ways in which reusers can inform the local authority about corrections to the data, such that those corrections are applied to it</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the star ratings, we note that the five stars as written in the Code are not the same as those first proposed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee (see http://5stardata.info/). There is a danger that local authorities will be confused by the mismatch. In particular, the 4-star definition within the code (which specifies the use of RDF and SPARQL and other standards from the W3C) is not the same as the original 4-star definition (which is that things should be identified using URIs).</p>
<p>We would recommend caution around prescribing particular data formats across the board. Different types of data are suited to different publication formats, both because of the nature of the data and because of the way in which the data will be used. Complex statistical spreadsheets, for example, are usually not best published as CSV files because CSV cannot support the rich information that is often embedded in statistical spreadsheets, such as notes and other metadata. SDMX is a good format for interchanging statistical data between national and international statistical agencies, but may not suit a start-up company. High-volume data is better suited to CSV than to any of the current RDF-based formats suggested by the definition in the code of 4-star data. It would be worth noting in the code that there are non-proprietary spreadsheet formats (OpenOffice or Open Document Formats) that can be used instead of CSV and should be used in preference to Microsoft Excel format.</p>
<p>Creating 3-star and particularly 4-star and 5-star data takes thought and investment of resources, and will therefore be hard for a local authority to manage as a blanket requirement across the wide variety of datasets that are being requested from them. 5-star data offers big advantages for reusers in the ease of combining data together, and for maintainers in reducing replication of data, and is therefore worth that investment for high-value datasets or where tools and services exist that make publishing of 5-star data convenient, easy and affordable.</p>
<p>Local authority data is particularly difficult to handle for reusers because it is published by hundreds of different organisations. It helps immensely if the local authorities publish the same data in the same standard format. One way to help local authorities to do this is for a central authority (such as the Department for Communities and Local Government or the Local Government Association, working through initiatives like the Local e-Government Standards Body) both to specify that format and to provide validation and visualisation tools that enable the local authorities to check that they are publishing data that meets those standards. Creating these standards and the tooling around them often takes investment of time and resources. Investment in standards and tools should be focussed where the impact will be greatest (such as reference data, high value datasets or datasets where there is greatest demand).</p>
<p>Our response to Question 2 describes some of the datasets that we think could benefit from this additional investment.</p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>we agree with the proposal to require local authorities to publish datasets as two-star (machine-readable) data</li>
<li>we suggest adding recommendations to ensure the sustainable publication of data</li>
<li>we suggest focusing efforts towards consistent, five-star publication for high impact datasets (typically reference data or high value datasets), where the benefits of linking data will be most keenly felt.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 5: Is the process of what will happen if the Code is to be enforced clear?</strong> </p>
<p>Any enforcement of the Code should take into account the resourcing and capabilities of the local authority.</p>
<p>There should be a provision in the Code for a mandatory mediation process, between local authorities and data reusers, or between local authorities and the department, in the case of any dispute about compliance with the Code. One option would be to modify or extend existing mediation services available for disputes around the reuse of public sector information. The Secretary of State could intervene in those cases where mediation had not proven successful.</p>

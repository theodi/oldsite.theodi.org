Concluding that power revealed itself through multiple layers of boredom, they decided that the best way to reveal the relations contained within the databases to the people affected by it would be to construct four contraptions which would enable visitors to: Test their aim with the Expenditure Filled Spud Gun; Balance the books with the Open Data Book Stabber; Polish the floor with an Older People Pneumatic Brusher; and, Grab the civic reins with the Public Expenditure Riding Machine.

The work incorporates contemporary data about working hours within the ‘digital’ economy, collected via a virtual punchcard on the project website,­ to map the shift from Owen’s ideal. Translating work patterns into knitting patterns using the similar punchcard technology, each misplaced stitch represents an hour of work done outside of the 8 hour ‘contract’.</p>\n              <p>Visitors are invited to contribute to the project by using the website to track their own working hours. The work has been created using a Brother KH950i electronic domestic knitting machine (produced 1988), and uses the DaviWorks IMG2Track software (daviworks.com/knitting) and PPD cable hack to transfer digital image files from the mac to the knitting machine.

Written by soldiers and officers, ​the data includes ​​intelligence information, ​descriptions of military actions, meetings​ and other information. The entries were analysed by software looking for repeated patterns of events, spatial information, kinds of actors, timings and other factors. While some of the data was interpreted and published by newspapers, the full data set - containing ​​endless permutation of jargon, acronyms and cross-references -​ ​remains mostly inaccessible. Endless War is a video installation ​revealing the real-time processing of this data seen from a series of different analytical points of view: each individual entry, phrase matching between entries and searches for the frequency of terms. It shows how the way war is thought relates to the way it is fought. \nBoth are seen as, potentially endless, computational processes. The algorithmic imaginary of contemporary power meshes with the drawn out failure of imperial adventure.</p>\n\n              <b>Artist biography: <a href=\"http://yoha.co.uk\">Yoha - Graham Harwood and Matsuko Yokokoji</a> & <a href=\"http://spc.org/fuller\">Matthew Fuller</a></b>  \n\n            </div>\n\n        <br />\n        <br />\n\n            <div>\n\n              <h3>Online Exhibition Catalogue: your fingerprints on the artworks are the artwork itself - an ODI commission</h3>\n\n              <img class=\"pull-left\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/59/03/535903871f986a2ef0000190/paolo-cirio_artwork.jpg\">\n\n              <p>Your fingerprints on the artworks are the artwork itself – an ODI Commission</p> \n\n              <p>Paolo was invited to conceptualise and develop an online catalogue that would be informative while questioning the cyclical nature of metadata.

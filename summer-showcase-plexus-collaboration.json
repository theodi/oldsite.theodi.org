Currently where we have needed the most support is around the press and comms for launching Plexus, from writing press releases to developing a comms plan.</blockquote></p>\n    <p><b>– Martin Vowles, Director of M/A</b></p>\n    <p>M/A was motivated by having the ODI’s institutional support and a limited timeframe in which to create a working prototype. Seeing what was possible in this time inspired M/A to seek out more funding opportunities to develop the concept in future. </p>\n    <p><blockquote>The confidence and belief gained by having the ODI support and back-up on and around the ideas of Plexus has been amazingly beneficial. The summer showcase has been a vital step in allowing us to create a working prototype; the associated time pressure has forced us to evolve and refine and be decisive. The seven weeks has also convinced the team at M/A that Plexus can become established and grow beyond the initial concept. To this end, we’ve spoken with Bethnal Green Ventures about applying to their winter–spring cohort by mid-October.</blockquote></p>\n    <p>Collaborating with the ODI also helped M/A to connect with people who could help bring Plexus to new audiences and help set up user-testing groups.</p>\n    <p><blockquote>Through the ODI network, we’ve been introduced to a staff member from the Department for Work and Pensions. Through this contact, we have now set up up a meeting to showcase Plexus and our plans. We have also been invited to attend a workshop in Whitehall, around how to best use data for JSA and Universal Credit happening in early October.</blockquote></p>\n    <p><blockquote>We’ve also had some support in making new contacts and introductions to help set up and run user-testing groups, and this work is still ongoing. We’ve had some conversations with Mind about being able to set up focus and user-testing groups that we hope to start working with in October.</blockquote></p>\n    <p>Martin and his team at M/A are looking forward to making more connections among ODI’s global network of startups, members and nodes and the wider open data community at <a href=\"http://theodi.org/events\" title=\"ODI events\">ODI events</a>.</p>\n    <p>Martin will be speaking about Plexus at the <a href=\"http;//summit.theodi.org\" title=\"ODI Summit 2015\">ODI Summit on 3 November 2015</a>.</p>\n\n    <div>\n      <a href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-plexus-what-next\" title=\"Next page\"><img class=\"pull-right\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/16/43/56164300f362be08b400000f/summer_showcase_next_but.svg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n      <a href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-plexus-methodology\" title=\"Previous page\"><img class=\"pull-left\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/29/f4/5629f4fe1f986a081e000033/previous.svg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n    </div>\n\n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"pull-left col-md-3\">\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-plexus\">About</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-plexus-background\">Background</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-plexus-about-the-data\">About the data</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-plexus-methodology\">Methodology</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box-opacity\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-plexus-collaboration\">Collaboration</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-plexus-what-next\">What next?</a>\n    </div>\n\n  </div>\n</div>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

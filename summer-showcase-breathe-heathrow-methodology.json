Groups like the Teddington Action Group, the Green Party and the Labour Party helped the team to find volunteers.</p>\n    <p>The team visited the participants over the course of a week and installed the sensors on the outside of their commercial buildings, beneath their windowsills, on the side of their sheds and beneath their garden tables. </p>\n    <p>On these visits, as well as installing the sensors, the <i>Breathe Heathrow</i> team also took them apart to show participants how they worked, trained them in accessing the data produced by OpenSensors, and explained basic principles of open data – data that anyone can access, use and share – and why they are important.</p>\n    <h3>The sensors and how they work</h3>\n    <p>The sensors used are <i>Air Quality Egg V2s,</i> modified to measure noise levels, provided by US-based Wicked Device. They produce data on temperature, humidity, noise, carbon monoxide levels and, importantly, NO2 levels.</p>\n    <p>This data is represented on a <a href=\"https://github.com/CurlyN/HeathrowAnalysis\" title=\"Breathe Heathrow Dashboard\">dashboard</a> created by <i>Breathe Heathrow</i>, taking the form of graphs and real-time pollution dials for every sensor.</p>\n    <h3>Putting air quality data into context</h3>\n    <p>As <i>Breathe Heathrow</i> is able to increase the coverage and depth of air quality and sound pollution datasets around Heathrow, with more granular data from a larger deployment of sensors and a longer time-series – ie time spent collecting data – they aim to take this project further. </p>\n    <p>Combining this data with data on flights, weather, local traffic and other local sources of air pollution data such as Kings College London’s <a href=\"http://aspx\" title=\"London Air Quality Network\">London Air Quality Network</a>, <i>Breathe Heathrow</i> hope to be able to demonstrate causalities between datasets.</p>\n    <blockquote>With strong winds, the local air pollution is lower; or for heavier planes (typically listed with a [HVY] prefix on flight datasets) the noise sensors may pick up higher noise levels in the vicinity of its glidepath – the route the plane takes when approaching a runway, or vice versa.</blockquote>\n    <p><b>– James Moulding, OpenSensors </b></p>\n    <blockquote>With frequent reports on how bad air quality is in London and notably around Heathrow – the intention of this government to allow for new capacity at Heathrow – I was interested in knowing how bad air quality already is where my family and I live, before it is allowed to get any worse. This is why I was keen to participate in this experiment and share the information openly.</blockquote>\n    <p><b>– Local resident </b></p>\n\n    <div>\n      <a href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow-lessons-learnt\" title=\"Next page\"><img class=\"pull-right\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/16/43/56164300f362be08b400000f/summer_showcase_next_but.svg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n      <a href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow-about-the-data\" title=\"Previous page\"><img class=\"pull-left\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/29/f4/5629f4fe1f986a081e000033/previous.svg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n    </div>\n\n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"pull-left col-md-3\">\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow\">About</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow-background\">Background</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow-about-the-data\">About the data</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box-opacity\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow-methodology\">Methodology</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow-lessons-learnt\">Lessons learnt</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow-collaboration\">Collaboration</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow-what-next\">What next?</a>\n    </div>\n\n  </div>\n</div>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

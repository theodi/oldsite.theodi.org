It raises questions about what it means to aggregate and interconnect large bodies of information, inviting reflection on how mechanisms like the World Wide Web, alter, extend and distort our understanding of the world around us. Thomson &amp; Craighead are keen observers of the ways in which people interact with these new spaces. Working with sound, video and sculpture, their materials include found YouTube footage, search terms and extracted texts from individual and corporate contributors to online media.</p>\n<p>For further information please contact <a href=\"mailto:dac@theodi.org\">mailto:dac@theodi.org</a></p>\n<p><em>Data as Culture 3: Data Anthropologies is curated by Hannah Redler, ODI Associate Curator in Residence, with Julie Freeman, ODI Art Associate and Gavin Starks, ODI CEO.

Beyond what they might have gathered from leaflets they had been given, it was difficult to understand more about the wider context in which their votes would be cast.</p>\n\n<p>Voters had no single, accessible, ‘official’ list of what elections were happening and where, and struggled to find out how many seats were up for election, in which councils, and what this might ultimately mean for who controls the places where we live.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s surprisingly hard to find good-quality information about the forthcoming local elections taking place on Thursday 5 May,\" Carr-West wrote in an <a href=\"http://www.publicsectorexecutive.com/News/out-for-the-count-/137299\" title=\"Out for the count article\">article</a> for PSE. “Voters may (or may not) have received polling cards, campaign leaflets through their letter boxes or even found aspiring councillors on their doorsteps, but it’s very hard to find out about the bigger picture: how many seats are up for election in which councils across the country, and what [might this mean] for who controls the councils we live in?”</p>\n\n  <p>With voters struggling to see the connection between their votes and the political direction of their councils, turnout was a concern, as Carr-West went on to explain in a <a href=\"http://www.lgiu.org.uk/2016/05/03/state-of-the-race-memo/\" title=\"Start of the race memo\">‘Start of the race’ memo</a> ahead of the elections.</p>\n\n<h3>Connecting voters with results data</h3>\n\n  <p>Frustrated by the fact that information that did exist about councillors had often been confined to PDF documents, hidden away on council websites, LGiU and Democracy Club were driven to develop Out for the Count to help address this issue, and help voters to be able to find clear election results for their councillors.</p>\n\n<p>The LGiU and Democracy Club teams saw an opportunity to collaborate on solving the problem of a lack of timely, open, collective local elections results.</p>\n\n  <p></p>\n  <a href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about\" title=\"Previous page\"><img class=\"pull-left\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/29/f4/5629f4fe1f986a081e000033/previous.svg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n  <a href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about-the-data\" title=\"Next page\"><img class=\"pull-right\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/16/43/56164300f362be08b400000f/summer_showcase_next_but.svg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n\n  </div>\n<div class=\"pull-left col-md-3\">\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about\">About</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box-opacity\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-background\">Background</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about-the-data\">About the data</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-methdology\">Methodology</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about-collaboration\">Collaboration</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about-what-next\">What next?</a>\n  </div>\n\n  </div>\n</div>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

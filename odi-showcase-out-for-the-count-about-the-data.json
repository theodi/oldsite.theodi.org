Thousands of editors, often including candidates themselves, helped to build a comprehensive open database that anyone could use to provide voters with better information about candidates – itself an iteration of mySociety’s <a href=\"https://github.com/mysociety/yournextrepresentative\" title=\"Your Next Representative\">YourNextRepresentative platform.</a> </p>\n\n<p>The challenge was greater for the 2016 local elections, with over 12,000 candidates for a range of different elections across the UK, with wider data points to consider like constituencies plus regions, and multiple winners across long lists of candidates. Driven by the popular demand for more detailed data about candidates themselves, volunteer ‘Count Correspondents’ added data such as profile photos, Twitter bios and Wikipedia entries.</p>\n\n<p>Having secured input from hundreds of Count Correspondents, the team crowdsourced details of every candidate into a database which voters could explore using the <a href=\"https://whocanivotefor.co.uk/\" title=\"WhoCanIVoteFor\">WhoCanIVoteFor</a> web application.</p>\n\n<p>The candidate database was also used by BuzzFeed to help inform their readers of elections near them, and by Democratic Dashboard to present candidates alongside past election results.</p>\n\n<p>In future, the team want to respond to user feedback to make the data about each candidate richer, with more on where candidates stand on issues, their priorities and plans if elected.</p>\n\n<p><b>Tracking results</b></p>\n\n<p>To track results on the night of the local election, a team of Count Correspondents entered the data into the database that Democracy Club used to manage candidates.</p>\n\n  <p>A live API made this data available to anyone who wanted it. Appending results data to the existing database further enriched the open data and allowed for historical trends to reveal themselves over time. The team hope ultimately to have instant results data fast enough to be able to notify voters of who won in their area, speeding up the feedback loop and giving them a more satisfying democratic experience.</p>\n\n  <p></p>\n  <a href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-methdology\" title=\"Next page\"><img class=\"pull-right\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/16/43/56164300f362be08b400000f/summer_showcase_next_but.svg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n  <a href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-background\" title=\"Previous page\"><img class=\"pull-left\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/29/f4/5629f4fe1f986a081e000033/previous.svg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n\n  </div>\n\n<div class=\"pull-left col-md-3\">\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about\">About</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-background\">Background</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box-opacity\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about-the-data\">About the data</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-methdology\">Methodology</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about-collaboration\">Collaboration</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about-what-next\">What next?</a>\n  </div>\n\n  </div>\n</div>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

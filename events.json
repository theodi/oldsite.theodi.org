In this lecture, ODI's Peter Wells explains how a bout of lunchtime whimsy led him to create an open data register of UK government cats.

From the social graph to the knowledge graph, the interest graph to the transactions graph, proprietary data networks drive the generation of new power and capital.</p>\n<p>Such graphs are used to make algorithmic predictions and optimisations about our future activities. Only those who can aggregate and hedge raw data emerge as the new power players.

He takes the obvious social, economical and political issues as input and runs through an abstract machinery, which generates network maps and algorithmic interfaces, results in performances and procreates predictions to render inherent power relationships visible and discussable. Arikan’s software, prints, installations, and performances have been featured in numerous exhibitions internationally. Arikan is the founder of Graph Commons, a collaborative platform for network mapping, analysis and publishing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"watchlive\">Watch live</h3>\n<p>There will be a live feed of the lunchtime lecture from 1pm on Friday 11 November.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/plMJR4I0uyk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","excerpt":"Friday lunchtime lectures are for everyone and are free to attend.

The UK spends £250 billion every year on public spending contracts, including vital public services like the NHS and it’s important that this money is spent as efficiently as possible.</p>\n<p>As part of an ASI fellowship, William Jones worked in collaboration with the UK Cabinet Office to increase the number of companies bidding on these contracts. He did this by automatically recommending them contracts which are available and relevant, using publicly accessible information from UK companies. The web application William built is called <a href=\"https://contract-recommender.herokuapp.com/\">Contracts Recommender</a>. His talk will explain the public sources of information he uses as well as how Contracts Recommender works.</p>\n<p><i><b>William Jones</b> was recently awarded the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science from the Cambridge Computer Laboratory with Distinction. During the ASI fellowship he first worked on a deep learning image classification project with <a href=\"http://tractable.io/\">Tractable.io</a>, using the convolutional neural network framework Caffe. Following this he joined a project with the Cabinet Office using natural language processing to automatically recommend relevant government procurement contracts to companies in the UK. He has just started a PhD in Mathematical Genomics at Cambridge.</p>\n<p></i></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2> About our Friday lunchtime lectures </h2>\n<p>With a broad range of topics in open data such as tracking government expenditure, British landscape mapping and creating art, there’s bound to be something that interests you.</p>\n<p>The sessions run from 1pm to 1.45pm weekly during UK school term-times, with informal networking until 2pm.

He relates this history to the open data movement, describing how live coders have opened up and shared the underlying structures of their music as free or open source software. Alex wraps up with some thoughts and predictions around where he thinks live coding is going, both in terms of creative practice and its wider cultural influences. </p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://slab.org/\">Alex McLean</a> is a live coding musician and software artist based in Sheffield UK.

For five minutes each day, Grace asks users questions about their challenges, confidence, positivity and how useful they have felt the day has been. Users can then explore the data they record in weekly, customised emails and a personalisable online dashboard. </p>\n<p>Plexus also uses machine learning to direct users to its knowledge base, which aggregates data sourced from over 25 different government services, NGOs and charities including <a href=\"http://www.mind.org.uk/?gclid=CJqh3vmY3swCFQUq0wodfV4ETQ\">Mind</a>, Martin Lewis's <a href=\"http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/\">Money Saving Expert</a> and <a href=\"http://england.shelter.org.uk/donate/100khomelesschildren?gclid=CJ6g6I2Z3swCFbYK0wod-tYNyw\">Shelter</a>.

The problem is, the global population is expanding and companies like North Pole Inc. everywhere are being forced to find new, more efficient ways of delivering services. </p>\n<p>This year, a crack team at North Pole Inc. has been working on developing and implementing the data infrastructure that Christmas needs, to keep children happy for years to come. </p>\n<p>Join us on 18 December to hear from North Pole Inc. <strong>CEO, Santa Claus; Head of Deliveries, Reiner Deerdale and Chief Elf Envisioner Sparkle Wonderdust</strong>. </p>\n<p>Look out for surprise guests!</p>\n<p><small class=\"pull-right\"><i>Photo: Flickr -<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregloby/3083873075/in/photolist-vWbF2G-iAwxWa-M6Qq1-fKBtV6-cpCkU-bRTWGn-4NpR81-7LNe1H-o1mFkN-rxwUBe-55GvQS-nrJbzn-93UEHF-6wKAPE-4DPCva-5GSnPt-4G6pp9-6mTTHR-hub9f-dyJ7de-qUiG12-5yMWoC-ziJkU9-e9r6yc-d3ycyu-cKrx1W-4oo77A-iz7Jw1-yaSnk-rRRMKF-6VAyq-e582An-aGhST-qjNVG2-4gxNTE-oMjSM6-fZoiTS-iqNVRR-ixVBiS-pda55o-5GvE2r-qp8u73-qa9sHx-ziKsnq-rWRtow-iaXnrH-9MHnEM-gUWopL-61tSB5-86iYQS\"> Greg Lobinski (CC-BY-2.0)</a></i></small></p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"bookyourplace\">Book your place</h3>\n<iframe src=\"//eventbrite.co.uk/tickets-external?eid=19800719485&ref=etckt\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"214\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"aboutourfridaylunchtimelectures\">About our Friday lunchtime lectures</h3>\n<p>With a broad range of topics in open data such as tracking government expenditure, British landscape mapping and creating art, there’s bound to be something that interests you. </p>\n<p>The sessions run from 1pm to 1.45pm weekly during UK school term-times, with informal networking until 2pm.

The Datacatcher: Big Data for the People</strong></p>\n<p>Earlier this year Goldsmiths University of deployed over 100 bespoke devices to people around London to see how they would shape their experiences of data and the city.  The devices, called <a href=\"http://www.datacatcher.org/\">Datacatchers</a>, show a stream of information drawn from numerous open and shared databases about their local surroundings. With information from the census, marketing sites, governmental agencies, and social media, they mutually illuminate the sociopolitical topology of the UK and the ways data represents that topology – and allow people to speak back by way of a series of somewhat irreverent poll questions. In this talk we describe the making of the Datacatchers, and show a few of the 50+ documentary videos we commissioned to build a picture of peoples' experiences.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/wgaver\">Bill Gaver</a> is Professor of Design and leads the Interaction Research Studio at Goldsmiths, University of London.

Its vision is that UK grantmaking is more informed, effective and strategic.</p>\n<p>360Giving supports organisations to publish their grants data in an open, standardised way and helps people to understand and use the data in order to support decision-making and learning across the charitable giving sector. They’ve developed an open data standard as part of their work – <a href=\"http://www.threesixtygiving.org/standard/\">the 360Giving Standard</a> – and already some of the largest UK grantmakers are using it to share information about thousands of grants worth billions of pounds.</p>\n<p>360Giving is also supporting the development of tools and platforms that allow easy access and use of the data, including <a href=\"http://www.beehivegiving.org/welcome\">Beehive Giving</a> and <a href=\"http://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/\">GrantNav</a>. As the dataset grows, they’re starting to test its usefulness via a series of data use pilots, starting in Manchester.</p>\n<p>This lunchtime lecture will focus on 360’s progress so far, including challenges and lessons learned. The 360Giving team is also interested to hear from ODI staff about implementing behaviour change within organisations based on better access to information and open data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"aboutthespeakers\">About the speakers</h3>\n<p><strong>Rachel Rank</strong> is Chief Executive of 360Giving.

It analyses and visualises numbers from and about government – on everything from staff numbers to public perceptions – to help politicians, civil servants, civil society and the public better understand what central government looks like in the UK. The Whitehall Monitor 2015 annual report looks at what happened under the coalition government from 2010 to 2015. Gavin Freeguard, one of the authors, talks us through some of the highlights.</p>\n<p><em>Gavin Freeguard is a senior researcher at the Institute for Government. His work has focused on leading Whitehall Monitor and also involved transparency in government contracting and preparing politicians for government. He was previously political adviser on culture, media and sport to Harriet Harman MP and, before that, deputy director of the Orwell Prize and senior editor at the Media Standards Trust. He is a trustee of the Orwell Youth Prize, a member of the Young Policy Professionals core group, and edits a daily email on data visualisation, Warning: Graphic Content.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"bookyourplace\">Book your place</h3>\n<iframe src=\"//eventbrite.co.uk/tickets-external?eid=20890400751&ref=etckt\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"214\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"livestream\">Live stream</h3>\n<p>If you’re unable to attend this lunchtime lecture you don’t need to miss out.

Genetic heart conditions, for example, affect around 1% of all newborns, and in around 10 times as many cases they may lead to miscarriage. If we want to prevent or treat birth defects, it’s vital that we understand how different gene mutations affect embryos as they develop.</p>\n<p>The DMDD (Deciphering the Mechanisms of Developmental Disorders) programme is tacking this issue by studying the effects of 240 different gene mutations in mouse embryos. In the spirit of open data, the project has made all its data freely available, to encourage collaboration and, ultimately, lead to better understanding of genetic disease.</p>\n<h3 id=\"aboutthespeaker\">About the speaker</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/a-z-researchers/researchers-k-o/tim-mohun/\">Dr Tim Mohun</a> is a developmental biologist at the Francis Crick Institute in central London.

Open data has great potential to help drive poverty eradication and improve global development outcomes. Data usage, however, remains relatively low. In the UK, for instance, a third of the datasets found on the government’s online portal have never been used. </p>\n<p>One reason for this is because it is hard to join-up data relating to funding, people and outcomes since it is published in different formats, and to different standards. This means that potential users of the data can’t easily see how various bits of data relate to each other. </p>\n<p>The Joined-Up Data Standards project has been exploring how data standards can be joined-up, using linked data and semantic mapping. While it is technically possible to join-up data standards in this way, political will and cooperation are key to making it happen. </p>\n<p>In this lecture, Tom Orrell will explain the work of the Joined-Up Data Standards project and outline political solutions at the international level for more interoperability between data standards, with the ultimate aim of improving decision-making and accountability. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/friday-lunchtime-lecture-why-joined-up-data-is-a-political-not-technical-challenge-tickets-27566148091\">Book your free place</a></p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ejjRsGE1WDU?list=PL6DDzoHu1cx1ozmghXXCgzwHF8Ln8Tlv8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>About the speaker</strong></p>\n<p><em>Tom Orrell is Publish What You Fund’s Senior Advocacy Advisor for the Joined-Up Data Standards project, run jointly by Publish What You Fund and Development Initiatives.

The exhibition is built around the practice of the 2016 ODI Sound Artist in Residence, Alex McLean, with a group of artists, designers, makers and musicians that he has collaborated with. Openness and processes of making – where any end results are left partly undone – are at the heart of many of the projects on display. The exhibition draws connections between the ways in which humans have captured, encoded and distributed data, and made it meaningful through pattern throughout history. From pre-Columbian Quipu and the ancient art of weaving to computer software environments, it introduces us to creative notions of code, and the ways in which it can carry both language and thought. </p>\n<p>The exhibition features artists and makers who are driven by radical intentions to expose the inner workings of the systemic structures we live with. We are encouraged to engage with these ourselves through art, software, folk songs, glitch aesthetics, chance encounters and knitted jumpers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bookavisit\">Book a visit</h3>\n<p>The artwork is displayed in the working offices of the Open Data Institute, so for a viewing please contact <a href=\"mailto:dac@theodi.org\">dac@theodi.org</a> to book a time slot to come and visit us. </p>\n<h3 id=\"artists\">Artists</h3>\n<p>Felicity Ford, David Griffiths and Julian Rohrhuber, Ellen Harlizius-Klück, Dan Hett, David Littler, Alex McLean, Antonio Roberts, Sam Meech, Amy Twigger Holroyd</p>\n<p>Curated by Alex McLean and Hannah Redler</p>\n<p><em>Alex McLean’s residency is made possible through a partnership with Sound and Music through their Embedded artist residency programme, supported by Arts Council England, the Esmee Fairbairn Foundation and PRSF Foundation.</em></p>","excerpt":"Thinking Out Loud is the fifth art exhibition at the Open Data Institute’s Shoreditch headquarters.\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"Thinking Out Loud art exhibition","end_date":"2017-03-31T16:00:00+00:00","location":"Open Data Institute, 65 Clifton Street, London EC2A 4JE","start_date":"2016-07-15T09:30:00+00:00","booking_url":"","hashtag":"ODOutLoud","event_type":"event:meetup","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Hannah Foulds","slug":"hannah-foulds","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/hannah-foulds","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme","odi-team"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/culture.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/culture","slug":"culture","title":"Data as Culture","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-08-19T11:02:10+00:00","created_at":"2012-11-25T22:02:06+00:00","tag_ids":["page","data-as-culture","culture","art","data-driven"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/alex-mclean-chosen-as-the-first-open-data-institute-sound-artist-in-residence.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/alex-mclean-chosen-as-the-first-open-data-institute-sound-artist-in-residence","slug":"alex-mclean-chosen-as-the-first-open-data-institute-sound-artist-in-residence","title":"Alex McLean chosen as the first Open Data Institute sound artist in residence","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-12-18T10:23:06+00:00","created_at":"2015-12-17T16:30:01+00:00","tag_ids":["news","data-as-culture","comission","alec-mclean","live-coding"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Hannah Foulds","slug":"hannah-foulds","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/hannah-foulds","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme","odi-team"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/three-things-you-need-to-know-to-be-an-effective-leader-in-the-world-of-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/summit/2016/training-day/sessions/three-things-you-need-to-know-to-be-an-effective-leader-in-the-world-of-open-data","slug":"three-things-you-need-to-know-to-be-an-effective-leader-in-the-world-of-open-data","title":"Three things you need to know to be an effective leader in the world of open data","format":"event","updated_at":"2016-09-27T15:56:43+00:00","created_at":"2016-09-05T13:45:50+00:00","tag_ids":["event:summit-training-day-session-2016","session-strategist","stream-strategist"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/events/event%3Asummit-training-day-session-2016.json","web_url":null,"title":"Summit training day session 2016","details":{"type":"event"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?event=event%3Asummit-training-day-session-2016","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/event%3Asummit-training-day-session-2016","slug":"event:summit-training-day-session-2016"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/session-strategist.json","web_url":null,"title":"session:strategist","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=session-strategist","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/session-strategist","slug":"session-strategist"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/stream-strategist.json","web_url":null,"title":"stream:strategist","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=stream-strategist","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/stream-strategist","slug":"stream-strategist"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>Open data is changing the way that businesses are working, which creates exciting opportunities as well as challenges for leaders.

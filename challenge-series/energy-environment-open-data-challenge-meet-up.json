The competition invites participants to use open data to develop products and services that tackle a specific UK energy challenge.</em></p>\n<p><strong>The Energy + Environment Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>The UK faces huge challenges in the area of energy: the costs of energy in our homes and businesses are increasing, we are struggling to limit our greenhouse gas emissions and we are reliant on energy from abroad, ultimately this raises questions about our energy security. At the same time we have access to more data than before on the nature of our energy consumption and other factors which affect our energy use, much of this is available as open data and leads us to set the challenge -</p>\n<p><strong>How can we use open data to develop tools and services that support communities to:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Group buy their energy and save money</li>\n<li>Undertake community based energy efficiency interventions; or</li>\n<li>Start to generate their own energy</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/energy-environment-open-data-challenge-meet-up-tickets-10616342767\">This meet up</a> will bring together people interested in taking part in the competition and being in the running to win up to £40,000. On the evening we will discuss the challenge question, showcase the datasets, explore your ideas and network.</p>\n<p><strong>Bristol</strong></p>\n<p>We're working with Bristol City Council and the people of Bristol as a test bed for the tools that are produced from this challenge. We will be looking for scalable, replicable solutions which could eventually be used by communities around the country.</p>\n<p><strong>Can’t make it?</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re unable to attend the meet up and are interested in participating in this challenge - you can take part anyway, just submit your idea on our <a href=\"http://collabfinder.com/groups/energy-environment-open-data-challenge\">CollabFinder</a> page to be considered to attend our Creation Weekend on 22 + 23 March at which three finalists will be chosen to receive £5,000 seed funding and support. After an incubation period, the final winning idea could receive up to £40,000 to launch their startup.</p>","excerpt":"The Open Data Institute and Nesta are running [an open data challenge around the theme of Energy and the Environment](http://www.nesta.org.uk/project/open-data-challenge-series/energy-environment).

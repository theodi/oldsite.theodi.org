These datasets could have significant social, environmental and economic benefits if released as high-quality open data. \n</b>\n    <p></p>\n    <img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/25/548725621f986a0882000014/light_green_break.png\">\n    <h4>Open up: invest in the release of important datasets as open data</h4>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The standard for UK public sector data is open by default. Geospatial data, address data, meteorological data and land valuations data all hold immense potential if released as high-quality open data. Trading funds including Ordnance Survey, the Met Office, Land Registry and Companies House need to be empowered to continue to release more open data. In Denmark, in 2002, the government made its national address file free; since then it has calculated a 30 to 1 ratio of direct financial benefits to cost.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/25/548725621f986a0882000014/light_green_break.png\">\n    <h4>Think big: use the National Information Infrastructure to plan for the future</h4>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-information-infrastructure\">National Information Infrastructure</a> is a potentially powerful strategic asset to prioritise and incentivise the release of important datasets.  It needs thoughtful design and investment so that it is more than a static list of datasets: it needs to change and evolve as other infrastructures do. So far, the NII has largely highlighted important but closed datasets, without a means of opening them up, or a plan for identifying future data assets. The new Chief Data Officer should be able to release important datasets identified through the NII as open data, taking account of what public bodies and the wider community want and need.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/25/548725621f986a0882000014/light_green_break.png\">\n    <h4>Set best-practice for the future: mandate that government procurement contracts require the release of open data</h4>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The UK has committed to being “open by default” under the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-data-charter\">G8 Open Data Charter</a>. Embedding open data into procurement contracts will ensure that data produced in future, as part of the delivery of goods and services for government, is opened up. The government should also proactively look for tenders that will generate significant amounts of data. The ODI has published a guide, <a href=\"http://training.theodi.org/Procurement/Guide/\">Procuring open data in the public sector</a>, which outlines how open data can be embedded into the procurement of public services.\n</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <a href=\"http://theodi.org/roadmap-uk-2015-step3\"><u class=\"pull-right\">next</u></a>\n    <p></p>\n      <img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/25/548725621f986a0882000014/light_green_break.png\">\n    <h2>The roadmap</h2>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <ul class=\"grid effect-2 listing\" id=\"grid2\">\n      <li class=\"home-module\">\n        <div class=\"module-event\">\n          <a href=\"http://theodi.org/roadmap-uk-2015-step1\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/64/548764df1f986a0882000020/1.png\"></a>\n      </li>\n      <li class=\"home-module\">\n        <div class=\"module-event\">\n          <a href=\"http://theodi.org/roadmap-uk-2015-step2\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/66/548766d31f986a0882000022/2.png\"></a>\n        </div>\n     </li>\n     <li class=\"home-module\">\n        <div class=\"module-event\">\n          <a href=\"http://theodi.org/roadmap-uk-2015-step3\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/65/548765afd0d46207f0000031/3.png\"></a>\n        </div>\n     </li>\n   </ul>\n </div>\n</div>\n <div class=\"pull-left col-md-3\">\n    <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document_downloads/249768188?extension=pdf&from=embed&source=embed\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/67/54876771d0d46207f0000037/download.png\" alt=\"\"></a>\n    <p></p>\n    <h3>Roadmap steps</h3>\n    <p></p>\n          <a href=\"http://theodi.org/roadmap-uk-2015-step1\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/68/54876819d0d46207f000003b/step1.png\"></a>\n    <p></p>   \n          <a href=\"http://theodi.org/roadmap-uk-2015-step2\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/67/54876776d0d46207f0000039/step2.png\"></a>\n    <p></p>   \n          <a href=\"http://theodi.org/roadmap-uk-2015-step3\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/68/54876819f362be08ee000031/step3.png\"></a>\n    <p></p>  \n    <img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/6f/54876f5df362be08ee000035/house.png\"> \n  </div>\n</div>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

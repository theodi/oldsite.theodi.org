The team also plan to further refine and use the model they have developed during by-elections over the next year, and for the local elections in 2017.</p>\n  <p>In future, the Out for the Count team hope to generate more data, more quickly and with more partners. Their goal is to be able to offer an email service to citizens in all councils, informing them of the results after elections.</p>\n  <p>”We want to show the value of having timely open data on elections, candidates and results and to encourage local government to provide this information in machine readable and discoverable format as well as citizen-accessible, human readable format,” says Joe Mitchell, Coordinator at Democracy Club CIC.</p>\n  <blockquote>We are working with the Cabinet Office, the LGA and others to ensure that we learn lessons from this year that can be applied to future elections – avoiding the (unnecessary) hard work of copying and pasting elections data to make it accessible to citizens and journalists. Together our goal is to have all councils publishing data openly and accessibly by the 2020 general and local elections.</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Lessons learned for future elections data projects</h3>\n\n<p>The Out for the Count team found that crowdsourcing candidate and results data was made much easier by having had an ‘army of volunteers‘ ready to go, so building a group of dedicated volunteers would be very valuable for other crowdsourcing projects in advance of elections. The team also found that council staff themselves were very good at adding data for their area, so engaging people working in councils and local authorities to contribute is key.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that the UK operates a relatively simple ‘first past the post’ electoral system made it straightforward to gather election and results data. It may not be quite so straightforward in other STV systems, such as a single transferable vote.</p>\n\n<p>The team also found that the idea of having a verified team member ‘check‘ all the crowdsourced data made sense at the time, but slowed the process down. ‘Trusting the crowd‘, is therefore something they advise wherever possible.</p>\n\n\n  <b>– Joe Mitchell, Coordinator, Democracy Club CIC</b>\n  <p></p>\n  <a href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about-collaboration\" title=\"Previous page\"><img class=\"pull-left\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/29/f4/5629f4fe1f986a081e000033/previous.svg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n\n  </div>\n\n<div class=\"pull-left col-md-3\">\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about\">About</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-background\">Background</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about-the-data\">About the data</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-methdology\">Methodology</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about-collaboration\">Collaboration</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box-opacity\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about-what-next\">What next?</a>\n  </div>\n\n  </div>\n</div>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

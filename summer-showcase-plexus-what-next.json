M/A is exploring how Plexus can link people with mental health conditions with employers in a two-way relationship, keeping their support relevant and helpful in the route back to work and to better mental health.</p>\n    <p>User testing will need to be carried out and spread across the country to get broad feedback, which will be used to: </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>refine content</li>\n      <li>add achievement badges and devise the methods in which they are gained, awarded to users and grow with interaction types</li>\n      <li>help create long-term relationships between pods of users across the country</li>\n      <li>help employers gain insight and greater understanding of the issues being faced by users</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>M/A has also applied to the accelerator programme <a href=\"http://bethnalgreenventures.com/\" title=\"Bethnal Green Ventures\">Bethnal Green Ventures</a> in the hope of having the opportunity to continue the development and evolution of Plexus as part of its Winter/Spring 15/16 cohort. </p>\n    <p>M/A is also developing an interactive tool, ‘Social Investment Matrix’, which maps the UK social investment market for the Cabinet Office, due for public release in November. M/A will also showcase the Plexus prototype and outline development plans to Cabinet Office for their insight, feedback and support.</p>\n    <p>With Mind data being a core offering of the app, M/A will strive to create a partnership with Mind around the tool to explore how it could have a positive effect on their communities and how it could be applied or adapted most usefully for their users.</p>\n    <p>M/A will also be releasing more of Mind’s datasets to the open data community and will further integrate the concept of data release within the organisation.</p>\n    <p>M/A will create sets of user testers to gain first-hand insight and feedback around Plexus to move it forwards. It will also create a rewards space so that users can see where they are successful and get feedback and support on their continued use of Plexus. Finally, M/A plans to use data specially chosen from the Department for Work and Pensions and combine it with data from Plexus users. </p>\n    <p><blockquote>We expect this to give our users an improved understanding of how the issue(s) they face on a daily basis are challenged and coped with by people the length and breadth of the country.</blockquote></p>\n    <p><b>– Martin Vowles, Director of M/A</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b><i>Do you think Plexus could be a useful tool for you or your organisation?

The Insight Centre for Data Analytics was created to realise this vision. Insight is a joint initiative between University College Dublin, the National University of Ireland at Galway, University College Cork, and Dublin City University. Insight was established in 2013 by Science Foundation Ireland.</p>\n<p>We combine the skills of leading researchers with cutting-edge technologies from diverse research areas. We work closely with industry partners to develop next-generation data acquisition and analytics solutions for important and diverse application areas.</p>\n<p>The eGov unit based at Insight in Galway formerly known as DERI, won the contract to lead Ireland's Open Data Initiative with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER). We developed a roadmap for Open Data in Ireland and established the national open data portal data.gov.ie. This is now managed by our spin-out company Derilinx.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"http://galway.theodi.org/\">ODI Galway</a>, we plan to deliver training courses for Open Data and provide support for the ODINE programme. We also aim to contribute to the Open Data community by holding public talks and networking events. We will make sure to engage with the wider open data community by supplying regular blogs and other forms of dissemination.</p>\n<p><strong>Get in touch with ODI Galway by visiting their <a href=\"http://galway.theodi.org/\">website</a></strong>.</p>","excerpt":"Learning & Network node\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"ODI Galway","url":"http://opendata.insight-centre.org/","telephone":"","twitter":"","linkedin":"","email":"niall.obrolchain@insight-centre.org","location":[0,0],"level":"city","region":"IE","beta":false,"area":"Galway","host":"The Insight Centre for Data Analytics","organizations":[],"author":{},"logo":{}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{}}

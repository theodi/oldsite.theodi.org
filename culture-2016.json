The exhibition is built around the practice of the 2016 ODI Sound Artist in Residence, Alex McLean, with a group of artists, designers, makers and musicians he has collaborated with. The exhibition draws connections between the ways in which humans have captured, encoded and distributed data, and made it meaningful through pattern throughout history. From Pre-Columbian quipu and the ancient art of weaving to computer software environments, it introduces us to creative notions of code, and the ways in which it can carry both language and thought.</p>\n<p>Openness and processes of making – where any end results are left partly undone – are at the heart of many of the projects on display. The exhibition features artists and makers who are driven by radical intentions to expose the inner workings of the systemic structures we live with. We are encouraged to engage with these ourselves through art, software, folk songs, glitch aesthetics, chance encounters and knitted jumpers.</p>\n<p><em>15 July 2016 – 31 March 2017</em></p>\n<p><em>Curated by Alex McLean and Hannah Redler</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"bookavisit\">Book a visit</h2>\n<p>The artwork is displayed in the working offices of the <a href=\"http://theodi.org/contact\">Open Data Institute</a>, so for a viewing, please fill out the form below to book a time slot to come and visit us.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/a/theodi.org/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSexOeag9vhapw3H6cy_YtcVWC8zUWt70sQM3xew-PA098Bu4g/viewform?embedded=true\" width=\"760\" height=\"250\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading...</iframe>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"theartists\">The artists</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/culture-2016-artists-felicity-ford\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/6b/57876b2ff362be56ab000014/ford.png\" alt=\"Felicity Ford\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/culture-2016-artists-david-griffiths-julian-rohrhuber\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/6b/57876b7fd0d462043d00002c/rohrhuber.png\" alt=\"David Griffiths and Julian Rohrhuber\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/culture-2016-artists-ellen-harlizus-kluck\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/6b/57876b7a1f986a535800002b/kluck.png\" alt=\"Ellen Harlizius-Kluck\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/culture-2016-artists-dan-hett\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/6b/57876b2fd0d462043d000026/hett.png\" alt=\"Dan Hett\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/culture-2016-artists-amy-twigger-holroyd\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/6b/57876b311f986a5358000023/holyroyd.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Twigger Holroyd\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/culture-2016-artists-david-littler\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/6c/57876c0ed0d462043d000030/littler.png\" alt=\"David Littler\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/culture-2016-artists-alex-mclean\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/6b/57876b7c1f986a535800002f/mclean.png\" alt=\"Alex McLean\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/culture-2016-artists-sam-meech\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/6b/57876beed0d462043d00002e/meech.png\" alt=\"Sam Meech\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/culture-2016-artists-antonio-roberts\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/6b/57876b7df362be56ab00001a/roberts.png\" alt=\"Antonio Roberts\" /></a></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/culture.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/culture","slug":"culture","title":"Data as Culture","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-08-19T11:02:10+00:00","created_at":"2012-11-25T22:02:06+00:00","tag_ids":["page","data-as-culture","culture","art","data-driven"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

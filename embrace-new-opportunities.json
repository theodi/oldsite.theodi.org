Find out how we can support you, and how we supported Defra to transform their sector.</p>\n<p>Our work is underpinned by research and insights from clients in businesses and governments around the world. The ODI was co-founded in 2012 by the inventor of the web Sir Tim Berners-Lee and AI expert Sir Nigel Shadbolt to address today’s global challenges using the web of data.</p>\n<p><a class=\"btn btn-info btn-lg \" href=\"mailto:bizdev@theodi.org\">Get in touch</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"enableinnovationacrossyoursector\">Enable innovation across your sector</h2>\n<p>Making the commitment to open your datasets can lead to countless opportunities and benefits.</p>\n<p>The Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) committed to opening 8,000 datasets in 2015, to create opportunities for people in the UK making their living from food, farming and the environment and change how parts of the Defra group worked together.</p>\n<p>To help support the process, the ODI’s Head of Policy was seconded to the department as an advisor on data to the Secretary of State. Defra used the ODI’s maturity model to map open data progress across its 34 organisations and sought strategic advice for the next phase of transformation. This helped Defra to develop a robust data infrastructure to encourage wide use and deliver on their release targets.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We are now building on what we learned from working closely with the ODI, ensuring our open datasets are used in new and exciting ways, internally and externally. We are also using that experience to show how better use of data can change the way Defra group works.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>– Mike Rose, Head of Data Engagement, Defra</p>\n<p><strong>Contact us</strong></p>\n<p>We'd love to talk to you about how we can help you to enable innovation across your sector.

Joining up assets and opening them for customers to integrate with their own data can drive efficiency and give them a much better experience.</p>\n<p>After acquiring smaller businesses, mass media and information company Thomson Reuters needed to integrate legacy data systems. The ODI helped them to create an innovative system that assigns a permanent identifier (PermID) to each data entity and makes it openly accessible via an online portal.</p>\n<p>We advised on best practice, co-wrote a white paper on creating value with identifiers and helped demonstrate Reuters’ commitment to publishing for users. We also applied our tools and services – such as the Open Data Certificate – to grow their expertise. </p>\n<p><strong>Contact us</strong></p>\n<p>We'd love to talk to you about how we can help you to reduce friction in your organisation.

We supported them to publish open data on agriculture efficiency indicators as part of their ‘Good Growth Plan’, and join networks to maximise its use and impact.</p>\n<p>Syngenta are seen as pioneering thought leaders in data innovation, publishing papers on the global data ecosystem for agriculture and food, and setting out a framework for collaboration across the sector.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Working with the ODI has enabled us to quickly explore open data as a new area, and do it with confidence. We found the ODI’s range of skills, capabilities, thinking and expertise vital to get us to where we are today with open data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Graham Mullier, Head of Data Sciences, R&amp;D IS, Syngenta</p>\n<p><strong>Contact us</strong></p>\n<p>We'd love to talk to you about how we can help you to build trust and better relationships in your organisation.

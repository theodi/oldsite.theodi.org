We would have welcomed the embedding of more substantive rights in the legislation, such as including a wider range of datasets, more exacting requirements on the formats that the data is provided in by public authorities, and a requirement for open licensing of published data, as we feel these would have better supported the government’s stated transparency and open data policies.</p>\n<p>In this context, the Code of Practice (datasets) is an opportunity to make a clear distinction between the low bar of minimum permissible practice under law, and good practice that public authorities are encouraged to aim towards in all their dataset publication practice.</p>\n<p>The current drafting of the Code too often emphasises the minimum that public authorities are required to do, when it should emphasise what public authorities should do, in the view of the Secretary of State, to adhere to good practice. The remainder of our response suggests new wording along these lines where appropriate.</p>\n<p>We strongly recommend that the Code:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>clearly states that by default, public authorities should publish their data in a re-usable format and as open data under the Open Government Licence</li>\n<li>covers good practice for all datasets; public authorities will use the Code to determine their policies for many datasets, not just those covered by the limited scope of the Act</li>\n<li>spells out the good reasons for making data available as open data, as described in the Open Data White Paper</li>\n<li>consolidates existing guidance for the publication of datasets by public authorities, including the Public Data Principles</li>\n<li>is clear about what the “exceptional circumstances” that might result in not using the Open Government Licence might be</li>\n<li>describes the additional burdens on public authorities that would result from using a Charged Licence</li>\n<li>requires public authorities that use a Charged Licence to publish the cost/benefit analysis they carry out in selecting that licence over the Open Government Licence</li>\n<li>recommends mediation when there are complaints</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"commentsoniintroduction\"> Comments on i. Introduction</h2>\n<p>The introduction should early on draw the distinction between the minimum requirements under the law and desirable activity under the Code. It should state that, to adhere to good practice in the view of the Secretary of State, public authorities should publish the data that they create and manage as open data, which <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/guide/what-open-data\">we define as “information that is available for anyone to use, for any purpose, at no cost”</a>, in a re-usable format and under the Open Government Licence. Any exceptions from this rule, in particular charging for data, should be justified, as they increase the administrative burden on both the public authority and raise substantial barriers to the use and reuse of the data.</p>\n<p>Paragraph 3 should be rephrased in a more positive way to encourage public authorities to publish open datasets, for example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>The Act and the Code are intended to increase regular publication of up-to-date datasets, in a re-usable format, and licensed to encourage their reuse. This Code requires public authorities to publish data that they manage in a reusable format and as open data. The Act does not require datasets to be maintained or updated if they would not otherwise be updated as part of the public authority’s function.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"commentsoniiscope\"> Comments on ii. Scope</h2>\n<p>Paragraph 7 states that the Code of Practice applies only to those datasets that are within the scope of the Act. The definition of the term “dataset” within the Act excludes a large amount of potentially useful data that could be published by a public authority, such as that resulting from modelling or analysis, any kind of official statistics, and any datasets that result from converting data from one form to another.</p>\n<p>Given the need for public authorities to adopt general policies around publishing datasets, which are unlikely to neatly match the scope of dataset in the legislation, it would be useful for the Code of Practice to be written so that it can be used as if it had a wider scope and to apply to any dataset owned by the public authority. It will avoid confusion and conflicting requirements for public authorities if the same good practice can apply to all these datasets as well as those included within the definition of “dataset” used by the Act.</p>\n<p>In Paragraph 9, the Code says “The purpose of releasing these datasets is to increase transparency and accountability of a public authority’s decisions and functions.” Public authorities should be encouraged to publish datasets, both in response to Freedom of Information requests and proactively, in order to reap the wider benefits from their release, as well as for transparency and accountability purposes. For example, publishing datasets could</p>\n<ul>\n<li>increase the efficiency of communication with service providers, partners and across the public sector</li>\n<li>enable the public authority to get feedback which improves the quality of its own data and therefore the decisions that it makes</li>\n<li>facilitate the entrepreneurial development of citizen-oriented services that improve the decisions that citizens make and support the creation of social, environmental and economic value</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Paragraphs 9 to 13 serve to highlight the difficulties with the definition of “dataset” used within the Act. For example, neither the Act nor the Explanatory Notes that accompany it make it clear that aggregation is classed as “calculation” rather than “analysis”, and therefore aggregated datasets are included within the definition of “dataset”. It is good to have this clarification, and important that it appears within the Code of Practice, as this is missing from the legislation.</p>\n<p>The Code of Practice should describe good practice for publishing datasets whether or not they fall under the Act’s definition of “dataset”. It should be made clear that the exclusions detailed within this section are there to enable the public authority to identify those datasets for which they are obliged to adhere to the Act and the Code. Where there is doubt, public authorities should be encouraged to err on the side of assuming that a dataset is covered by the Act and follow the best practice set out by Code.</p>\n<p>The description of datasets covered by the Act should also be reframed more positively in the Code, to emphasise that many datasets are covered, for example, Paragraph 10 could be rephrased with:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Raw or source data is included in the scope of a dataset, as is aggregation of data to form high-level datasets (such as the creation of regional figures that were collected at a district level, or the creation of annual figures from data that were collected weekly).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Paragraph 12, it would also be useful to clarify whether datasets that are modified through data cleansing (eg reformatting dates to a consistent format) or correction (eg revising an incorrect date) are also excluded from the definition of “dataset”. In our experience, this processing is commonly required on data to be released as open data, and increases the data quality for the public authority itself as well as for potential reusers. It would also be useful, in Paragraph 12, to describe whether redaction (eg removing columns containing personal data) is classified as the material alteration of a dataset.</p>\n<p>Paragraph 14 highlights that some datasets are not covered by the Act or Code because they are not relevant copyright works. This paragraph should note, for the avoidance of doubt, that datasets that are subject to Crown Copyright must be published under the Open Government Licence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"commentsoniiidisclosingdatasetsinanelectronicformwhichiscapableofreuse\"> Comments on iii. Disclosing datasets in an electronic form which is capable of reuse</h2>\n<p>Paragraph 11 defines “reusable format” as a “machine-readable format”, but publishing data in a machine-readable format does not necessarily make it reusable. In particular, if the machine-readable format is a proprietary format that is only readable when using expensive proprietary software from a single vendor, particularly if it cannot be easily exported to other formats, then it is not practically re-usable. The Code should encourage data publication in formats defined by open standards, such as CSV, XML, JSON and RDF, where there is good availability of open source tooling, such as readers, parsers and converters, for processing the data. This is consistent with government’s policy favouring the use of open standards and the appropriate use of open source tools.</p>\n<p>Paragraph 12 states that datasets are often created in formats that are capable of re-use. Unfortunately, this is often not the case: datasets are often created in proprietary applications which used closed data formats. It is more accurate to say that many of the applications that public authorities use to capture and manage data, such as Microsoft Access or Excel, support export into re-usable formats such as CSV.</p>\n<p>The final sentence of Paragraph 12 could be more positively framed as “To gain the maximum benefits from the reuse of datasets, public authorities should investigate the possibility of converting data to re-usable formats for publication. The Act does not oblige public authorities to carry out this conversion if it is impractical or overly burdensome.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"commentsonivstandardsapplicabletopublicauthoritiesinconnectionwiththedisclosureofadataset\"> Comments on iv. Standards applicable to public authorities in connection with the disclosure of a dataset</h2>\n<p>Paragraph 14 refers to the Public Data Principles. It would be useful if the Public Data Principles were combined with this Code of Practice, so that public authorities only need to look at one document to work out what to do, and to avoid conflicting advice being given in the two documents. The Code of Practice should stand in its own right as a statement of good practice.</p>\n<p>Paragraph 15 refers to Sir Tim Berners-Lee’s Five Star ranking system but provides a link to his Linked Data Design Principles, which is altogether different. The most helpful link for the five-star scheme is <a href=\"http://5stardata.info/\">http://5stardata.info/</a>. The final sentence of this paragraph talks about “applicants … assessing the suitability for re-use of a dataset they have received”, which the five-star scheme does not help with. Instead, the five-star scheme should be used by public authorities to guide their decisions about how to publish datasets. The final sentence should be replaced by:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This Code recommends that datasets are published at the three-star level at a minimum, and that public authorities aim to publish datasets that are likely to have a wide impact at a five-star level.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Paragraph 16 could again be reworded more positively as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Published datasets should be accompanied by a sufficient amount of metadata and contextual information about how and why the dataset was compiled or created, and the processing that it has gone through, in order that users may fully comprehend the dataset they are dealing with and as part of compliance with Section 16 (duty to advise and assist) of the Act. Only where there are good reasons for this information not to be provided should it be omitted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Paragraph 17 is excellent in giving strong guidance for the use of open standards that emphasises what public authorities should do rather than what they can get away with not doing. This paragraph should highlight that when private-sector organisations collect and manage data on behalf of public authorities, the rights to that data should be transferred to the public authority. This reduces the amount of third-party intellectual property within datasets managed by the public authority, and therefore increase the potential for publication of those datasets as open data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"commentsonvgivingpermissionfordatasetstobereused\"> Comments on v. Giving permission for datasets to be reused</h2>\n<p>We are pleased to see the emphasis in this section on publishing the licence under which a dataset is made available alongside the dataset itself. This alleviates the uncertainty that otherwise exists about whether a particular dataset can be reused. It should be made clear from the outset of this section that the Code recommends publication of datasets under the Open Government Licence.</p>\n<p>Paragraph 18 mentions third-party intellectual property rights. Many users of the Code will not be familiar with the subtleties of copyright, database rights, third-party intellectual property rights, or derived data. It would be good for this section to include a definition for these concepts and/or point to other sources that define them such as <a href=\"http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types.htm\">the Intellectual Property Office</a>.</p>\n<p>The Code should encourage public authorities to publish the details of any third-party intellectual property rights that prevent a dataset from being published under the Open Government Licence, as this will help policy makers trace the impact of fundamental datasets in preventing the publication of public sector information as open data. These details should be published as open data, so that the impact can be aggregated across the public sector by policy makers.</p>\n<p>It would be helpful for this section to specifically address the issue of Ordnance Survey and Royal Mail data included both directly and as derived data within datasets, as this is the most common source of third-party intellectual property rights within datasets managed by public authorities.</p>\n<p>The Code should indicate that the Act states that the public authority has a legal obligation to publish the full, unmodified, dataset with a licence that highlights the third-party intellectual property rights within the data and therefore limits its potential for reuse. The Code should also advise that the public authority should also remove any data that cannot be openly licensed and publish the resulting dataset as open data, under the Open Government Licence. This would enable those parts of the data that aren’t covered by third-party intellectual property rights to be re-used.</p>\n<p>In Paragraph 21, it would be worth highlighting that the ongoing business-as-usual information risk assessment practices carried out by the public authority should already include the assessment of the rights within the data as the public authority needs to ensure that it complies with the licence it has been granted in its own internal use of that data. The assessment of suitability for publication should be part of this assessment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"commentsonlicensing\">Comments on Licensing</h3>\n<p>Paragraph 22 should be reworded to more strongly guide public authorities towards publication of datasets as open data. We suggest:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Public authorities are strongly advised and encouraged to use the UK Open Government Licence to license the datasets they publish. The Act permits public authorities to use other licences, as described in this Code, but their use is strongly discouraged. They should only be used in exceptional circumstances, and the reasons for doing so openly documented.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Paragraph 23, the UK Open Government Licence should be described as the recommended licensing model for the UK Government.</p>\n<p>Paragraphs 24 and 25 should be grouped together to indicate that neither the Non-Commercial Government Licence and the Charged Licence are recommended licences. For example, it could say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>In exceptional circumstances, public authorities may publish datasets under one of the following licences:</li>\n  </ol>\n  <ul>\n  <li><p>Non-Commercial Government Licence: this was developed to meet circumstances where data cannot be reused for commercial purposes. As with the Open Government Licence, public authorities can link to the Non-Commercial Government Licence on The National Archives website (http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/non-commercial-government- licence).</p></li>\n  <li><p>Charged Licence (Beta): this is a transactional licence being developed for circumstances where reuse for commercial purposes requires the payment of a fee and/or royalties by the reuser. The licence uses standard licensing terms and forms part of the UK Government Licensing Framework and is available on the National Archives website (http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information- management/government-licensing/charged-licence.htm).</p></li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This section should make it clear what “exceptional circumstances” might entail using one of these licences. It should also point out the cost involved in administering transactional licences.</p>\n<h2 id=\"commentsonvicostsandfees\"> Comments on vi. Costs and fees</h2>\n<p>In this section, the Code should point out that given a dataset is made available in machine-readable form (as any relevant dataset must be, under the Act), the public authority will usually incur no additional cost in making that data available under an open licence. On the contrary, publishing the data under a transactional Charged Licence will be more costly for the public authority, because of the administrative overhead involved in its publication such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>costs involved in restricting use of data, both legal (eg suing infringers) and technical (eg through digital rights management technologies)</li>\n<li>costs involved in issuing and renewing licences</li>\n<li>the cost of legal advice</li>\n<li>the cost of handling enquiries about the licensing arrangement</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Code should make these costs clear and explain the consequent rationale for the recommendation to use the Open Government Licence.</p>\n<p>We would like the Code to require that any public authority that charges for reuse of a dataset publish, as open data, an assessment of the cost/benefit of publishing under a Charged Licence compared to publishing under the Open Government Licence. For data managed by public authorities, this assessment should include the benefits to the wider economy rather than simply the benefits to the authority that manages the dataset.</p>\n<p>In Paragraph 32, we see the potential for the Secretary of State to specify that certain classes of dataset must be made available as open data. This power should be invoked if public authorities do not routinely follow the Code and best practice, by allowing their data to be reused as open data. The power should be presented as one that, in extremis, can be used by the Secretary of State to ensure that datasets are published as open data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"commentsonviiconsideringpublicationofdatasetsaspartofapublicationscheme\"> Comments on vii. Considering publication of datasets as part of a publication scheme</h2>\n<p>This section contains some very good guidance for public authorities and we are wholly supportive of its content.</p>\n<p>In Paragraph 36, it would be useful if the Code described how to check whether a dataset is available through the UK Government Web Archive (ie go to <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/*/%7Bdataset-uri\">http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/*/{dataset-uri</a>}).</p>\n<p>Paragraph 38 could be rephrased more positively as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When the authority publishes the dataset under its publication scheme, to maximise the benefit of making the data available, it must (as for responding to a request) provide it in an electronic form that is capable of reuse, where it is reasonably practicable to do so. What is reasonably practicable will again depend on the circumstances in each case and include the same considerations when dealing with a request, e.g. the cost of doing so, the work involved in doing any conversion and whether any specialist equipment or software is required.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"commentsonixcomplaints\"> Comments on ix. Complaints</h2>\n<p>The Code should set out the roles of the Information Commissioner, the Office of Public Sector Information and the Open Data User Group, in handling requests and complaints about the availability of datasets. The Open Data Institute would like to see a single point of contact for the public to which complaints about the licensing and general availability of reuse of data and datasets should be addressed.</p>\n<p>The Open Data Institute would also like to see a mandatory mediation process between public authorities and reusers as a way of resolving disputes, particularly around licensing and charging issues.</p>","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/consultation-on-the-uk-implementation-of-directive-201337eu.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/consultation-responses/consultation-on-the-uk-implementation-of-directive-201337eu","slug":"consultation-on-the-uk-implementation-of-directive-201337eu","title":"Consultation on the UK implementation of Directive 2013/37/EU","format":"timed_item","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:57:31+00:00","created_at":"2014-10-15T08:38:42+00:00","tag_ids":["consultation-response","consultation-response","consultation","consultation-response"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/consultation-response.json","web_url":null,"title":"consultation response","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=consultation-response","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/consultation-response","slug":"consultation-response"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/consultation-response.json","web_url":null,"title":"consultation response","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=consultation-response","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/consultation-response","slug":"consultation-response"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/consultation.json","web_url":null,"title":"consultation","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=consultation","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/consultation","slug":"consultation"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/consultation-response.json","web_url":null,"title":"consultation response","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=consultation-response","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/consultation-response","slug":"consultation-response"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>The Open Data Institute <strong>(ODI)</strong> thanks The National Archives for the opportunity to comment on the UK Government’s proposed implementation of the amended EU Directive on the re-use of public sector information (Directive 2013/37/EU) **(PSI Directive). **The ODI is joined in making this submission by <a href=\"https://okfn.org/\">Open Knowledge</a>, <a href=\"http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/\">KnowWhere Consulting</a>, <a href=\"http://www.siriusopensource.com/\">Sirius Corporation Ltd</a> and <a href=\"http://www.logicalspark.com/\">LogicalSpark Limited</a>. </p>","excerpt":" Executive summary:\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"Consultation response","content":"<h3 id=\"executivesummary\">Executive summary:</h3>\n<p>The Open Data Institute <strong>(ODI)</strong> thanks The National Archives for the opportunity to comment on the UK Government’s proposed implementation of the amended EU Directive on the re-use of public sector information (Directive 2013/37/EU) **(PSI Directive). **The ODI is joined in making this submission by <a href=\"https://okfn.org/\">Open Knowledge</a>, <a href=\"http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/\">KnowWhere Consulting</a>, <a href=\"http://www.siriusopensource.com/\">Sirius Corporation Ltd</a> and <a href=\"http://www.logicalspark.com/\">LogicalSpark Limited</a>. </p>\n<p>The UK has been a world leader in supporting and encouraging the re-use of public sector information. The Office of Public Sector Information <strong>(OPSI)</strong> has played an important role in this, overseeing the introduction of the Open Government Licence, the Information Fair Trader Scheme and exceptions to marginal cost pricing, as well as mediation and redress mechanisms for complaints. </p>\n<p>The ODI is concerned, however, that the UK Government’s proposed implementation of the 2013 PSI Directive is a backwards step. It is out of sync with existing initiatives introduced by OPSI as well as the prevailing Open Data policy led by the Cabinet Office. It is disproportionately focused on reducing burdens on the public sector, rather than facilitating an optimal environment for re-use. The ODI fears this approach loses sight of broader policy objectives in opening up public data: encouraging economic growth, enhancing government transparency and accountability and uncovering new social and environmental benefits. </p>\n<h3 id=\"article4redress\">Article 4: Redress</h3>\n<p>The ODI supports the aim of the Government’s proposed redress mechanism: to ensure that decisions on complaints about the re-use of public information are legally binding. However, the ODI remains concerned the bulk of proposed costs and risk of seeking this means of redress from a tribunal will be met by re-users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"article6chargingoptions\">Article 6: Charging options</h3>\n<p>The ODI is concerned by a lack of clarity regarding charges for re-use of some (exempted) public information. It does not define how exemptions for certain public sector bodies are to be granted, and how the additional charges set by these exempted bodies are to be calculated. The proposed implementation seems to reverse existing structures in place for exceptions to marginal cost pricing, which are strictly applied before a public body is able to apply charges.  The proposed changes could facilitate greater charging for re-use of public information in the UK than is currently permitted. </p>\n<h3 id=\"abouttheorganisations\">About the organisations</h3>\n<p><em>The <a href=\"http://theodi.org/\">Open Data Institute</a> is an independent, non-profit and non-partisan company based in London.

This will reduce cost and efficiency burdens for both re-users and public sector bodies.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Question 1</strong></p>\n<p>Do you agree that this represents the most appropriate way to deliver the means of redress required by the amending Directive? If you do not agree, what do you think would be suitable alternative and why?</p>\n<p><strong>No.</strong></p>\n<p>It’s unclear how the proposed referral of decisions to a First-tier tribunal will interact with existing redress processes. There are currently three stages of the OPSI complaints process:</p>\n<p><strong>Stage One:</strong>     Resolution with originating public sector body</p>\n<p><strong>Stage Two:</strong>     Appeal to the Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage Three:</strong>     Appeal to the Advisory Panel on Public Sector Information (APPSI)</p>\n<p>Would the First-tier tribunal be a fourth stage in the complaints process? Or would it replace stage three? The Impact Assessment indicates that re-users or public bodies could appeal to the First-tier tribunal if they are unhappy with a (non-binding) recommendation from OPSI. The ODI is concerned that there is no enforcement mechanism if OPSI recommendations are in favour of the complainant. We are also concerned that an additional tribunal stage on top of the existing complaints process will result in delays and increased costs for both the public sector bodies and re-users involved, and act as a chilling factor on re-use. The worst outcome of an amendment to the existing redress mechanism in the UK would be one that suppresses potentially innovative new uses of public data. </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/opsi-complaints-process-audit-report.pdf\">last audit</a> of the OPSI complaints process undertaken by APPSI panel member Phillip Webb in 2011 indicated that the time frame for resolution of complaints [as of 2011] varied between 1 to 325 days. <em>(NOTE:  http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/opsi-complaints-process-audit-report.pdf p8)</em> 64% of complaints to OPSI were resolved within 7.4 days, with 36% moving on through the full complaints process. <em>(NOTE:  ibid.)</em> With one third of complaints seemingly requiring protracted resolution, the ODI fears that a lengthy and ultimately non-binding process with OPSI will discourage re-use of public-sector information. </p>\n<p>Since its amalgamation with The National Archives, the identity and visibility of OPSI has been obscured. In his 2011 audit of the OPSI complaint process, Webb recommended that clear statements be provided on The National Archives site and in other relevant places on legislation.gov.uk establishing the status of OPSI and its relationship with The National Archives <em>(Recommendation 3)</em>. <em>(NOTE:  Above n 2, 7.)</em> Today, The National Archives website still does not clearly establish its relationship with OPSI, which can be confusing for re-users trying to exercise their redress abilities under the Regulations. OPSI is similarly invisible on GOV.UK. The National Archives is a major information holder in its own right, which can be perceived to be a source of conflict for OPSI exercising its complaints resolution role. To continue to occupy this role, safeguards must be put in place to ensure OPSI's responsibilities are not obscured by any conflict of interest with TNA. </p>\n<p>The ODI believes the best way of implementing the amended PSI Directive is to provide an independent regulator with power in legislation to enforce decisions on the re-use of public sector information, just as there are for decisions related to Freedom of Information requests. As APPSI said in their response to the PSI Directive Consultation <em>(NOTE:  http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/APPSI-PSI-Directive-Consultation-Response-2010.pdf )</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"one of the problems experienced by private companies is the absence of real sanctions that could be applied in cases where PSBs [public sector bodies] are non-compliant\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Information Commissioner’s Office, the established independent authority whose mission is to uphold information rights in the public interest, <em>(NOTE:  http://ico.org.uk/what<em>we</em>cover)</em> is well placed to do this. ICO already rules on complaints under the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000, among other areas of legislation. This would align the regulatory regime for re-use of information with the regime for access, which is particularly relevant since the \"Right to Data\" was introduced in the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012. </p>\n<p>While ICO lacks experience with regulating PSI re-use, the recent review by APPSI following a complaint about OPSI by 77M <em>(NOTE:  https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/appsi-review-board-report-77m-september-2014.pdf)</em> highlights the fact that OPSI lacks the necessary technical expertise:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The Board acknowledges OPSI’s long history of furthering the cause of re-use of Public Sector Information. However some of the issues that are now being encountered (as evidenced in this report) are increasingly technical, even arcane and vary from one data domain to another. For this reason we urge OPSI to draw upon external experts on a contracted basis to provide the necessary detailed technical knowledge, background and other expertise not readily available from OPSI’s internal resources. The Board Recommends that OPSI establishes a contracted panel of external business and technical experts on which it can readily call for assistance when addressing these more complex commercial and technical issues. This might operate by employing a model similar to that used by the Cabinet Office for Major Project and Gateway Reviews.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The ODI notes the consideration of this option in the Consultation (Option C) and concerns regarding possible devolution of complaints related to Scottish public sector bodies being routed through the Scottish Information Commissioner’s Office. The ODI has confidence in the ability of Scotland’s Information Commissioner’s Office to work with the ICO, with both authorities sharing the same mission: to uphold information rights in the public interest. </p>\n<p><strong>For these reasons, the ODI believes the Information Commissioner's Office is best placed to rule on and enforce decisions regarding re-use of public sector information. Regardless of which body regulates in this area, it needs to have the power to make binding decisions.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Question 2</strong></p>\n<p>Do you consider that the First-tier Tribunal is the appropriate body to hear and determine appeals against decisions made under the amending Directive?</p>\n<p><strong>Yes.</strong> </p>\n<p>However, the ODI is concerned that the length and complexity of First-tier Tribunal proceedings will be a barrier to uptake by re-users. </p>\n<p>There appear to be fees implied in the Tribunal route to be borne by the complainant, as well as potential additional costs: a First-tier Tribunal has the power to award costs against claims deemed unreasonable, *(NOTE:  Rule no 10, Orders for Costs, http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/tribunals/general/consolidated-TPFTT-GRC-Rules2009-6-04-12.pdf) which will further deter pursuit of this appeal option unless \"unreasonable\" is clearly and simply defined. </p>\n<p>If a First-tier Tribunal is the desired body, its implementation should reflect the objective of the amending PSI Directive: to encourage re-use of public information. To best do this, the ODI believes there should be no fees for complainants to use the Tribunal. An award of costs against public sector bodies in the event of a successful appeal may also stimulate greater release of information in the first place, and reduce the need for Tribunal proceedings. </p>\n<p>Further, the ODI believes that appeals to a First-tier Tribunal should be minimised through ensuring that it is possible for a complainant to get a legally binding decision earlier in the process, as described in our answer to Question 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Question 3</strong> </p>\n<p>Do you consider that the General Regulatory Chamber Rules of the First-tier Tribunal will suit the handling of these appeals? The General Regulatory Chamber Rules may be found at: <strong><a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/tribunals/rules\">http://www.justice.gov.uk/tribunals/rules</a></strong></p>\n<p>The ODI’s first preference is for an independent authority with an existing investigative function who can hear complaints on re-use and make binding decisions. The ICO already exercises this function for complaints under the FOI regime, and is well placed to exercise a similar function for complaints on re-use. Relevant resources from OPSI could be transferred to the ICO to assist with this function and/or ICO could draw on an external panel of experts, as APPSI recommended that OPSI do <em>(see our response to Question 1 above)</em>. </p>\n<p>In the event an existing regulator like ICO is not utilised, the General Regulatory Chamber Rules (GRCR) must be adjusted or wielded in a way that does not impose cost or administrative burdens on complainants, which can be easily followed and which facilitate timely decision making. </p>\n<p>Otherwise, the GRCR appear too long and complex for the complaints process. They will particularly deter appeal by individuals, start-ups and SMEs who have limited access to legal advice: exactly the groups who are intended to be the main beneficiaries of PSI available at marginal cost. </p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"article6chargingoptions-1\">Article 6: Charging options</h3>\n<p><strong>Proposal:</strong> </p>\n<p>That where charges above marginal costs are made, such charges should should be calculated according to objective, transparent and verifiable criteria in UK legislation. The total charge should not exceed the cost of collection, production, reproduction and dissemination together with a reasonable return on investment.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> </p>\n<p>That the Government (a) clarify the calculation by which above marginal costs will be determined, and (b) how this will interact with existing processes for above marginal costs charging under the Government Licensing Framework.</p>\n<p><strong>Question 4</strong> </p>\n<p>Do you have any comments about the proposed approach to laying down criteria for the calculation of charges in cases where charges above marginal cost are made?</p>\n<p>It’s unclear to the ODI exactly what criteria the Government is proposing to introduce for the calculation of charges above marginal cost. Is the criteria to be, \"costs not exceeding the cost of collection, production, reproduction and dissemination together with a reasonable return on investment\"? The ODI fears such general criteria will enable greater charging for public sector information than is currently permitted. This is directly contrary to the stated aim of the amended PSI Directive: to stimulate greater release and re-use of public sector information. </p>\n<p>The existing <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/criteria-exceptions-marginal-cost-pricing.pdf\">Government Licensing Framework</a> sets out 19 rigorous criteria, including 5 mandatory criteria for above marginal costs charging. <em>(NOTE: http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/criteria-exceptions-marginal-cost-pricing.pdf)</em> Public bodies wishing to charge above marginal costs <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/exception-to-marginal-cost-pricing-application-guidelines.pdf\">must apply to OPSI for an exemption</a> on a case by case basis and demonstrate that they meet these criteria. <em>(NOTE: http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/exception-to-marginal-cost-pricing-application-guidelines.pdf)</em> Some public bodies can seek accreditation from OPSI to be excluded from this case-by-case criteria under the <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/ifts-and-regulation/ifts-verification-process/\">Information Fair Trader Scheme</a>. <em>(NOTE: http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/ifts-and-regulation/ifts-verification-process/)</em> Again, there are strict requirements for a public body to be registered under the IFTS. </p>\n<p>The existing framework is not perfect. The list of <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/ifts-and-regulation/ifts-members/\">registered IFTS members</a> <em>(NOTE: http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/ifts-and-regulation/ifts-members/)</em> (who can charge above marginal cost recovery) includes public bodies with stewardship of core reference datasets - like the Met Office, Ordnance Survey and Land Registry - which hold significant potential if released as open data. The Public Administration Committee (PASC) report on <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-administration-select-committee/news/statistics-and-open-data-response/\">Statistics and Open Data</a>, <em>(NOTE: http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-administration-select-committee/news/statistics-and-open-data-response/)</em> released in March 2014, highlights the need for a \"radical new approach to the funding of government open data\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"A modest part of the cost to the public of statutory registrations should be earmarked for ensuring that the resultant data - suitably anonymised if necessary - can become open data. Data held by the Land Registry and car registration data held by DVLA and, indeed, Care.data held by the NHS are among relevant examples.\" (paragraph 75)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In July 2014, the European Commission published its guidelines on recommended standard licences, datasets and charging for the reuse of documents (<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/commission-notice-guidelines-recommended-standard-licences-datasets-and-charging-re-use\">2014/C 240/01</a>), to assist EU Member States implementing the amended PSI Directive. It sets out explicit criteria to guide charging, that should be taken into account by the UK. </p>\n<p>Regarding transparency, the EU guidelines encourage public bodies to publish the amounts of revenue received through charging for the re-use of the information they hold (4.3). In their submission to this consultation, the Open Data User Group (ODUG) emphasises the need for greater transparency around additional charges, including for implementing any charging regime. The ODI believes that the publication of the kind of information considered by ODUG, as well as information regarding charging revenue, should be a requirement for public bodies seeking to charge above marginal cost under the UK’s amended Regulations. </p>\n<p>UK implementation of the PSI Directive should build on the recommendations contained in PASC’s 2014 report, and existing mechanisms in place. At the very least, it could enshrine existing mechanisms in the Regulations, to require approval from OPSI before a public body is able to charge for re-use above marginal cost. It should require the publication of information about costs, including the revenue received from above marginal cost pricing, the costs of implementing charges and from maintaining the data asset, for public bodies seeking to charge above marginal cost. Instead, the ODI fears that the UK’s proposed implementation will be a backwards step.</p>\n<h3 id=\"question5\">Question 5</h3>\n<p>With reference to the Impact Assessment, are there any other impacts, benefits or implications of the proposals which should be considered?</p>\n<p>The Impact Assessment currently sets very low expectations of how many people will seek appeal of re-use decisions, and how much the tribunal process will cost. If the proposed charging criteria results in greater charging for re-use of information, then this could result in more appeals. Alternatively, increased costs combined with the complexity of the proposed tribunal appeal process could put people off appealing re-use decisions altogether. This would be the worst outcome, and furthest from the aims of the PSI Directive. </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/impact-assessment.pdf\">Impact Assessment assumes</a> there will be no change in the volume of complaints and that a tribunal will require 7.7 days of panel sitting time. <em>(NOTE: http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/impact-assessment.pdf p2)</em> Their assumptions seem to be based on Webb’s 2011 audit report of OPSI complaints, and don’t take into account the potential for increased appeals if the proposed amendments allow more public sector charging for information. </p>\n<p>They also incorrectly estimate the time costs of a tribunal hearing. Webb’s 2011 audit of the OPSI complaints process indicated that while 64% of complaints were resolved by OPSI within 7.4 days, these were <em>prior to moving through the full complaints process.</em> <em>(NOTE: above n2.)</em> The one third of complaints that did move through formal OPSI processes could take up to 325 days to reach a recommendation. The Impact Assessment contemplates redress to a tribunal being available <em>after</em> OPSI has made its recommendation, which will add further delays to the process. <em>(NOTE:  Paragraph 5.6, above n. 11.)</em></p>\n<p>The Impact Assessment should take into account the potential impact of changes to existing cost charging criteria (if this is proposed), and potential increased likelihood of appeals as a result. </p>\n<h3 id=\"othercomments\">Other comments</h3>\n<p>The National Archives should publish a draft of the regulations prior to implementation. It’s unclear from this Consultation exactly how the UK is intending to update its existing Regulations. The ODI looks forward to an opportunity to review the proposed regulations. </p>\n<p>The consultation document also indicates there may be a need for amendment to the provisions on the release and re-use of requested datasets under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) as amended by section 102 of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012. Is The National Archives able to give any indication as to when a consultation on this process will take place? The ODI would be glad to contribute to this. </p>","end_date":"2014-10-13T23:00:00+00:00","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/consultation-response-national-infrastructure-assessment.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/consultation-response-national-infrastructure-assessment","slug":"consultation-response-national-infrastructure-assessment","title":"Consultation response: National Infrastructure Assessment","format":"article","updated_at":"2017-01-04T11:01:42+00:00","created_at":"2017-01-04T10:53:18+00:00","tag_ids":["consultation-response","page","data-infrastructure"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/consultation-response.json","web_url":null,"title":"consultation response","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=consultation-response","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/consultation-response","slug":"consultation-response"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/page.json","web_url":null,"title":"Page","details":{"description":"Page","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=page","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/page","slug":"page"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/data-infrastructure.json","web_url":null,"title":"data infrastructure","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=data-infrastructure","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/data-infrastructure","slug":"data-infrastructure"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"In May 2016, the UK government issued a [consultation](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/national-infrastructure-assessment-consultation) into the process and methodology of the National Infrastructure Assessment (NIA).\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"Consultation response: National Infrastructure Assessment","url":"","content":"<p>In May 2016, the UK government issued a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/national-infrastructure-assessment-consultation\">consultation</a> into the process and methodology of the National Infrastructure Assessment (NIA).</p>\n<p>The ODI’s mission is to connect, equip and inspire people around the world to innovate with data.

The new company would be called “NewCo”.</p>\n<p>The Open Data Institute’s mission is to connect, enable and inspire people to innovate with data. We work globally. Last year the UK government asked the ODI to <a href=\"https://theodi.org/blog/odi-welcomes-new-role-with-cabinet-office\">bring the voice of data businesses and innovators to the Cabinet Office</a> and promote data innovation across government.</p>\n<p>The Open Data Institute's response is based on our focus on data and was produced with assistance from our <a href=\"http://theodi.org/our-network\">global network</a>. It uses our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ol8uw1u7EE9oGYjW0IR9OSXYmtw_Vk5jB_Likfp_rS0/edit#\">openly produced themes</a> for this response, <a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/seven-principles-to-help-us-strengthen-our-data-infrastructure\">draft principles for data infrastructure</a>, the evidence of the <a href=\"http://theodi.org/the-value-of-open-data\">value of open data</a> and the importance of <a href=\"http://theodi.org/data-infrastructure\">data as infrastructure to a 21st-century economy</a>.</p>\n<p>The Land Registry's impact on our society and economy is wide and far-reaching. Whilst its core services underpin the property market, the data that the Land Registry holds and publishes is used in many more sectors. The data allows people to build services that help people, businesses and governments to make better decisions.</p>\n<p>The consultation is flawed in its lack of information about these uses and lack of understanding of the risks inherent in creating a private sector NewCo that would hold a monopoly over this data and will be competing with its own customers in producing services that use it. </p>\n<p>We recognise the government’s overarching objective of a capital receipt but it is clear that the proposed approach is significantly flawed.</p>\n<p>In the Open Data Institute’s response we propose that if the Government chooses to continue with its plans it should:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>separate the data registry from the end-user services built on top of it before the move to the private sector</li>\n<li>create and deliver on a legislative framework to make the UK’s data infrastructure as open as possible</li>\n<li>ensure that the organisation that maintains the data registry is subject to Freedom of Information legislation</li>\n<li>ensure the oversight function has the necessary skills and powers to oversee both the Land Registry and the market of services that use the data it publishes</li>\n<li>publish any information it holds that describes how the Land Registry’s data is used and the value that this creates</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We understand the impact these recommendations will have on the upfront price that government may receive but it will be a better long-term choice. Many private sector bidders will want to take the easy route of profit from a position of monopoly over the Land Registry's data but organisations that maintain core data assets are <a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/seven-principles-to-help-us-strengthen-our-data-infrastructure\">essential to our data infrastructure and must be as open as possible</a>. They should be creating healthy and open markets, not centralised monopolies.</p>\n<p>Government could still choose to retain the Land Registry in the public sector. In which case our recommendations to release more open data, to free it from restrictive third party data and to publish information about the value the Land Registry’s data creates would continue to apply.</p>\n<p>As the Land Registry, and other trading funds, continue down the path to privatisation, government needs to ensure that the data they maintain is as open and accessible as possible. In many cases that means more open than it is already. If government continues with the privatisation without these, or similar, corrections then it risks repeating the <a href=\"https://theodi.org/news/paf-decision-flies-face-government-commitments-odi\">historic mistakes</a> that it made with the Royal Mail privatisation and that it is now <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/geoplace-conference-matt-hancock-speech\">having to unpick</a>.</p>\n<p>If government does not make difficult choices such as correcting its proposed model, or reconsidering whether privatisation is even appropriate for such as an important piece of data infrastructure as land and property ownership, then it risks weakening our data infrastructure. </p>\n<p>This will damage many of the services we currently receive, weaken innovation, increase the chance of corruption and decrease economic stability. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Read the ODI's Land Registry Consultation Response in full <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L-11245C6uBydZOBByOIMIh3c_vDrttP39IGM1vMJXI/edit#\">here</a></em></strong></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-responds-uk-land-registry-privatisation-consultation.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-responds-uk-land-registry-privatisation-consultation","slug":"odi-responds-uk-land-registry-privatisation-consultation","title":"ODI responds to UK Land Registry privatisation consultation","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-05-26T16:12:47+00:00","created_at":"2016-04-20T10:35:11+00:00","tag_ids":["consultation-response","news","land-registry","data-infrastructure"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/research-economic-value-open-paid-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/research-economic-value-open-paid-data","slug":"research-economic-value-open-paid-data","title":"Research: The economic value of open versus paid data","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-04-20T11:21:06+00:00","created_at":"2016-04-19T15:26:37+00:00","tag_ids":["page","economic","land-registry"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/new-research-exposes-risk-privatising-land-registry-restricting-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/new-research-exposes-risk-privatising-land-registry-restricting-data","slug":"new-research-exposes-risk-privatising-land-registry-restricting-data","title":"New research exposes risks in privatising the UK Land Registry and restricting its data","format":"article","updated_at":"2017-01-03T11:03:48+00:00","created_at":"2016-04-20T08:11:59+00:00","tag_ids":["news","land-registry","data-infrastructure","economic"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/improving-local-government-transparency.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/consultation-responses/improving-local-government-transparency","slug":"improving-local-government-transparency","title":"Improving local government transparency","format":"timed_item","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:51:54+00:00","created_at":"2012-11-28T15:14:00+00:00","tag_ids":["consultation-response"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/consultation-response.json","web_url":null,"title":"consultation response","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=consultation-response","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/consultation-response","slug":"consultation-response"}}],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"excerpt":"Question 1: What amendments or additions could be made to paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Code to aid compliance?","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"content":"<p><strong>Question 1: What amendments or additions could be made to paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Code to aid compliance?</strong></p>\n<p>Paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Code address the creation and maintenance of an inventory of public data by each local authority.</p>\n<p>In our experience, inventories and lists of datasets are hard and time-consuming to create, costly to maintain, and tend to get out of date. From a reusers perspective, a large, unfocused, out-of-date inventory, particularly of datasets that they cannot actually access without going through a Freedom of Information process, is more frustrating than helpful. It is therefore important to balance the cost of creating and maintaining such a list with the benefits that it provides to potential reusers.</p>\n<p>There are three lists of datasets that should be maintained by a local authority:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An internal list of their information assets, which should be maintained and reviewed as part of their information asset risk management, on a business-as-usual basis. The review of information assets should include their suitability as a source for published datasets, in particular taking into account the source of the data and whether the local authority has the right to republish or derive data from it. Often the published datasets will be extracts or summaries of the data held within a particular information asset.</li>\n<li>A list of published datasets; if a local authority registers these datasets on data.gov.uk, such a list can be generated automatically and does not require additional work by the local authority. For the purposes of <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1515/regulation/16/made\">Regulation 16 of the Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations</a>, this is also “a list of main documents available for re-use”.</li>\n<li>A prioritised inventory of candidate datasets for publication, alongside indicative dates of planned publication. This list should include datasets that the authority aspires to publish in future, even if there is no date for publication, as this will help assess demand. Information previously requested under Freedom of Information or through the data request process managed by the Open Data User Group is a good candidate for proactive publication as open data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When considering the publication of datasets in the second and third lists described above, local authorities are already obliged to publish their publication scheme, which lists the classes of information that they are making available. Local authorities should consider where they hold structured data for each class of information in the publication\u0002scheme as a means of identifying potentially useful datasets for publication.</p>\n<p>To aid the location of published data, we would also encourage local authorities to register the datasets they do publish on data.gov.uk and to embed links and pointers to these datasets from suitable places within the local authority website. For example, data about taxi licences should be made available from the web pages about taxi licences; data about recycling facilities should be made available from the web pages about recycling facilities.</p>\n<p>If the Code includes a requirement for local authorities to publish an inventory of unpublished datasets, we think that it should be specific about what information is required within the inventory. If it is not, we find that different organisations tend to make different judgement calls about what should be included, supply it in different formats and provide data that cannot be compared across organisations. We also note that local authorities hold a potentially unlimited supply of datasets, corresponding to different extracts from their information assets, and listing all of them is both infeasible and unhelpful.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we believe that it would be useful to in addition provide within the Code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a definition of “dataset” that would enable local authorities to assess what should be listed within the inventory (eg “the highest value spreadsheets, databases and data-holding documents maintained by the local authority whose contents — redacted, anonymised or aggregated as necessary — would be made available under a Freedom of Information request”)</li>\n<li>a definition of how the inventory itself should be published (eg as an CSV spreadsheet, rather than as a PDF document) and that the inventory should be registered on data.gov.uk to ensure that it is discoverable as well as accessible</li>\n<li>a description of what information should be included within the inventory about each dataset (eg the same minimal information required for registering that dataset on data.gov.uk)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Question 2: What data streams could be added to the Code to aid transparency where services are contracted-out; and help greater access to contract information?</strong></p>\n<p>Local authorities should ensure that when services are contracted out, they are granted the rights to all the data that is created as a result of providing the service. This ensures that the local authority is able to reuse the data themselves, as well as preventing them from being locked in to a particular service provider. Publishing this data will aid competition between suppliers when contracts are next procured. Good suppliers should be enthusiastic to show the world how well they are delivering services through the publication of performance data.</p>\n<p>We would also suggest adding a requirement that the service provider publish as open data any non-personal performance information that is related to the contracted-out service and is required under the contract to be reported back to the local authority.</p>\n<p>This will help reduce the overhead on both sides of the contract as the local authority can access the performance information that it needs in a flexible way. It will help make sure that that those public services delivered under contract enable growth and accountability through data reuse in the same way as other services.</p>\n<p>When services are contracted out, we would also encourage local authorities to publish the contracts themselves in a structured form (such that each clause is addressable on the web), as open data. This enables third parties who are dependent on the service to understand the agreement that has been made between the local authority and the service provider, and therefore what service they should expect, and to alert the local authority if the agreement is breached.</p>\n<p><strong>Question 3: Are there other data sets which would be useful to the public which could be added to paragraph 12 of the Code? In particular, is there any data that would:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Support Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and local businesses</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Support the release of surplus Local Authority land and property?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The datasets that are proposed within paragraph 12 of the Code enable transparency but are not datasets on which local businesses can be built. The following datasets, held by local authorities, would enable the creation of tools and businesses that might improve public services for the citizen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>records of licences issued (and those refused) for different services provided in the area would enable the creation of applications to locate those services, as well as to check whether an organisation or individual is licensed for that service and to alert licensees about requirements to renew their licence</li>\n<li>school catchment areas and/or selection policies would enable tools to be built that helped parents to choose where to live</li>\n<li>information about parking spaces, for both cars and bikes, including their location, restrictions, charging and utilisation, would aid the creation of applications that helped citizens choose where to park, as well as planning for additional parking spaces</li>\n<li>data about the creation of new roads, changes to street names, and about the boundaries and locations of points of interest within the local authority area would help the maintenance of maps, including open maps provided by OpenStreetMap</li>\n<li>planning information that describes new developments and extensions would enable the creation of alerting tools that help citizens understand planned developments in their area</li>\n<li>detailed information about bus stops, including whether they have shelters, seats and other accessibility features, would help the tailoring of transport applications for those people with impaired mobility</li>\n<li>engineering logs that detail faults fixed and who performed the work would enable the creation of tools that rate particular engineers and subcontractors (and help the local authority select those who perform better) and would help those moving into an area or a particular property to understand what maintenance has been carried out; it would also enable new entrants to identify where underperforming contractors could be supplanted by a better service</li>\n<li>lists of empty buildings would help property developers to identify properties that they could potentially purchase and develop</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In cases where datasets cannot be released under the Open Government Licence (for example due to being Ordnance Survey derived data), we would encourage the publication of the dataset excluding that derived data, rather than entirely excluding its publication. If the data is published without these fields, it is possible that the excluded data can be derived from other sources (such as OpenStreetMap or through crowd-sourcing) that do not have the same restrictions, and therefore that reusers can benefit from the data that can be released.</p>\n<p><strong>Question 4: Is the description of minimum standards and proposed timing to achieve them correct?</strong></p>\n<p>The sustainability of data publication is all important for those who build services on top of that data. So long as it is machine-readable (2-star) and openly licensed (as described in paragraph 14), the frequency, consistency and accuracy of the publication of a dataset is more important than the format in which it is published. We would therefore suggest adding recommendations to the Code that require local authorities</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to make the publication of open data sustainable by incorporating it into existing processes and workflows</li>\n<li>to publish metadata about each dataset that include information about the frequency with which it will be refreshed and provide mechanisms to inform reusers about those updates</li>\n<li>to consider the ways in which reusers can inform the local authority about corrections to the data, such that those corrections are applied to it</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regarding the star ratings, we note that the five stars as written in the Code are not the same as those first proposed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee (see http://5stardata.info/). There is a danger that local authorities will be confused by the mismatch. In particular, the 4-star definition within the code (which specifies the use of RDF and SPARQL and other standards from the W3C) is not the same as the original 4-star definition (which is that things should be identified using URIs).</p>\n<p>We would recommend caution around prescribing particular data formats across the board. Different types of data are suited to different publication formats, both because of the nature of the data and because of the way in which the data will be used. Complex statistical spreadsheets, for example, are usually not best published as CSV files because CSV cannot support the rich information that is often embedded in statistical spreadsheets, such as notes and other metadata. SDMX is a good format for interchanging statistical data between national and international statistical agencies, but may not suit a start-up company. High-volume data is better suited to CSV than to any of the current RDF-based formats suggested by the definition in the code of 4-star data. It would be worth noting in the code that there are non-proprietary spreadsheet formats (OpenOffice or Open Document Formats) that can be used instead of CSV and should be used in preference to Microsoft Excel format.</p>\n<p>Creating 3-star and particularly 4-star and 5-star data takes thought and investment of resources, and will therefore be hard for a local authority to manage as a blanket requirement across the wide variety of datasets that are being requested from them. 5-star data offers big advantages for reusers in the ease of combining data together, and for maintainers in reducing replication of data, and is therefore worth that investment for high-value datasets or where tools and services exist that make publishing of 5-star data convenient, easy and affordable.</p>\n<p>Local authority data is particularly difficult to handle for reusers because it is published by hundreds of different organisations. It helps immensely if the local authorities publish the same data in the same standard format. One way to help local authorities to do this is for a central authority (such as the Department for Communities and Local Government or the Local Government Association, working through initiatives like the Local e-Government Standards Body) both to specify that format and to provide validation and visualisation tools that enable the local authorities to check that they are publishing data that meets those standards. Creating these standards and the tooling around them often takes investment of time and resources. Investment in standards and tools should be focussed where the impact will be greatest (such as reference data, high value datasets or datasets where there is greatest demand).</p>\n<p>Our response to Question 2 describes some of the datasets that we think could benefit from this additional investment.</p>\n<p>In summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>we agree with the proposal to require local authorities to publish datasets as two-star (machine-readable) data</li>\n<li>we suggest adding recommendations to ensure the sustainable publication of data</li>\n<li>we suggest focusing efforts towards consistent, five-star publication for high impact datasets (typically reference data or high value datasets), where the benefits of linking data will be most keenly felt.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Question 5: Is the process of what will happen if the Code is to be enforced clear?</strong>  </p>\n<p>Any enforcement of the Code should take into account the resourcing and capabilities of the local authority.</p>\n<p>There should be a provision in the Code for a mandatory mediation process, between local authorities and data reusers, or between local authorities and the department, in the case of any dispute about compliance with the Code. One option would be to modify or extend existing mediation services available for disputes around the reuse of public sector information. The Secretary of State could intervene in those cases where mediation had not proven successful.</p>","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/independent-public-sector-information-review.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/consultation-responses/independent-public-sector-information-review","slug":"independent-public-sector-information-review","title":"Independent Public Sector Information Review","format":"timed_item","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:51:59+00:00","created_at":"2013-03-25T15:29:47+00:00","tag_ids":["consultation-response"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/consultation-response.json","web_url":null,"title":"consultation response","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=consultation-response","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/consultation-response","slug":"consultation-response"}}],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"excerpt":"Issues of fairness, openness and quality dominated a session on the economic value of open data at the ODI.

Head of an independent review of public sector information, Stephan Shakespeare was joined by more than 40 CEOs, government officials and geeks on Monday 18<sup>th</sup> March 2013\u0002for “Open Data Market Makers”*.</p>\n<p>The event started with presentations by three start-up businesses that are currently building products, services and revenues from open data. <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/case-study/mastodon-c\">Mastodon C</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/case-study/placr\">Placr</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/case-study/opencorporates\">Open Corporates</a> are all based at the ODI, working with big data, transport data and company data respectively.</p>\n<p>ODI CEO, Gavin Starks said that the three were examples of great new companies emerging from the open data market. In an anecdote, an angel investor in one of the companies likened the ODI to a swimming coach he met 25 years ago. The coach said that he was “not trying to create a champion” but an environment in which “champions are inevitable”.</p>\n<p>Framing the session, Stephan Shakespeare said he is interested in two main things: what should be in a national strategy for data ? and; what can be done to maximise the economic benefits ?</p>\n<h2 id=\"keythemes\">Key themes</h2>\n<p>The debate was chaired by the ODI’s Commercial Director, Stuart Coleman and a number of themes emerged:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>**<a href=\"#fairness\">Fairness</a>: **the need to develop a level playing field between government and the private sector.</li>\n<li>**<a href=\"#rules\">Rules & regulations</a>: **how to make more data available and the role of legislation.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"#opportunities\">Opportunities for businesses</a>:</strong> what established businesses can gain from open data.</li>\n<li>**<a href=\"#privacy\">Privacy</a>: **misconceptions about open data vs personal data.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"#consistency\">Consistency and quality</a>:</strong> the idea of opening data first and cleaning it up later.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"fairness\">Fairness</h2>\n<p>Several attendees made the point that when “government turns developer” there can be problems for private sector companies hoping to build businesses on public sector data. One private sector delegate said that his company had been working on a product using government data whilst unbeknownst to him, government was doing the same thing itself. The work cost his organisation a lot of money, which could have been avoided if government was more transparent about the work it was already doing.</p>\n<p>Others claimed that the key issue is to ensure equality by giving private sector developers access to data at the same time as it begins to be used internally. In fact, said one CEO, as soon as officials decide to build something using their data, it should be released externally.</p>\n<p>There are huge differences in the amount and quality of the data that is openly available in different sectors, according to a number of attendees. Transport data, said one, is being released in vast quantities and “everyone is playing with it”. The same is not true of health, crime and justice data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rulesregulations\">Rules &amp; regulations</h2>\n<p>There was a discussion about the data that government has monetised through its trading funds. One audience member said that there can be a feeling amongst officials that these revenues must be protected. However, there is probably a great deal more value to be realised from releasing the data openly.</p>\n<p>The same person went on to describe the ODI as “an island of hope in a sea of despair”. There are very few sanctions available against government bodies that refuse to share their data, he added. Unlike the Freedom of Information Act, there is nothing that requires officials to explain why they will not make data openly available. This was a recurrent theme throughout the session and something which audience members agreed needs addressing. Some spoke in favour or legislation, others for clear, unambiguous guidelines, stopping short of legislation.</p>\n<p>The audience’s comments received a sympathetic response from Stephan Shakespeare. He said that his first recommendation will look at clarifying how people can get hold of public sector data and under what circumstances requests can be turned down.</p>\n<h2 id=\"opportunitiesforbusiness\">Opportunities for business</h2>\n<p>Two large organisations that are using open data to develop products and services for their customers spoke about the opportunities presented by the emerging market. “It feels like the rebirth of the internet” said one, adding that he relishes the chance to bring open data to the consumer world.</p>\n<p>Acknowledging that there is some nervousness around open data (in particular where people confuse it with personal data), he added that he is seeking to reassure his customers that their privacy will not be compromised. He rounded up that there are opportunities for those companies that embrace open data to “get a head start” on others.</p>\n<p>Another organisation using open data said that they wanted to be a catalyst for transforming the use of open data to enhance public services to benefit peoples’ lives.</p>\n<h2 id=\"privacy\">Privacy</h2>\n<p>Picking up on points about privacy and data protection, one CEO said that the Shakespeare review should also focus on education. Open data and personal data can get conflated in peoples’ minds and this needs to be addressed if the opportunities are to be fully realised.</p>\n<p>The ODI’s Gavin Starks added that this is one area where the Institute is working hard to build understanding through its training programmes, guides and face-to-face work with businesses and organisations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"consistencyandquality\">Consistency and quality</h2>\n<p>One venture capitalist in the audience remarked that getting data published is not an easy process and that it would be wrong to expect perfection. Sometimes, he added, it should be enough for the data to be “fit for purpose”, although the definition of that term is debateable in itself.</p>\n<p>Another attendee remarked that “perfect is the enemy of good enough” whilst Gavin Starks added that once the data becomes open, you can “start throwing start-ups at it to help clean up the data”.</p>\n<p>Stephan Shakespeare added that he will be recommending a National Core Data Set of clean, useable data for certain datasets. However, this won’t mean that other data can’t be published. One of the key areas he is exploring is how much we should insist that data meets certain standards and whether it is acceptable to have two levels of data: some raw and dirty and; some clean.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The views and opinions gathered at the event will inform the Shakespeare Review and the ODI is looking at creating further events to explore the issues. Feedback from the session included a chorus of voices asking the ODI to do “more of the same”.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/guest-blog-open-data-market-makers\">Read a blog</a> by the co-founder of ODI-based start-up, Locatable</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This event was held under the Chatham House Rule, which means that all comments can be reproduced but are non-attributable.

focussed on data and openness.</em> </p>\n<p>The ODI works to build a strong, fair and sustainable data economy in which data gets to the people who need it. We believe that openness is a vital mechanism to create a data economy that works for everyone. We recommend that openness forms one of the pillars of the industrial strategy.</p>\n<p>Data is one of the UK’s key strengths – at local, devolved and national levels – and it is the right time to invest to build on that strength. We are going through a data revolution due to the growth of the web and internet coupled with the drop in the price of software and hardware. Data has become a new form of <a href=\"http://theodi.org/data-infrastructure\">infrastructure</a> for a 21st century economy.</p>\n<p>Investing in our data economy can create significant growth in productivity and economic value across sectors. The UK has capacity to create jobs and value using data and a competitive advantage compared to other nations.</p>\n<p><strong>The response provides priority areas for action on data:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>developing a shared vision</strong> for a strong data infrastructure across the whole UK to help grow the economy in all regions and make the UK a competitive place to grow or start a business </li>\n<li><strong>ensuring sector deals are developed in the open</strong> and help build open data infrastructure</li>\n<li><strong>using the Industrial Challenge Strategy Fund</strong> to support research into data infrastructure, skills, open innovation, and into building in equity, engagement and ethics to data use</li>\n<li><strong>encouraging national, devolved and local government</strong> to work with local institutions, such as the <a href=\"http://theodi.org/nodes\">ODI Nodes</a>, and support peer networks</li>\n<li><strong>publishing open data</strong> on the capabilities and strengths of different places and sectors</li>\n<li><strong>providing data skills and literacy</strong> through a combination of government and business-provided training and better designed services</li>\n<li><strong>funding better tools</strong> for data discoverability and building open geospatial data infrastructure</li>\n<li><strong>using public sector transformation and procurement</strong> to open up data and encourage the use of open standards</li>\n<li><strong>using fiscal incentives and challenges</strong> to encourage the private sector to open data to drive innovation</li>\n<li><strong>ensuring the UK continues to be a welcoming place for migrants</strong> in the tech industry</li>\n<li><strong>revisiting data legislation</strong> as part of the process for exiting the UK</li>\n<li><strong>securing a data adequacy arrangement with the EU</strong> and ensuring no disruption to non-EU data flows</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the response we have provided some sector-specific detail on the importance of data and openness in the energy and artificial intelligence sectors. Similar thinking could be applied to other areas such as <a href=\"https://theodi.org/blog/uk-government-must-support-data-sharing-and-open-data-in-transport-or-risk-being-left-behind?utm_content=buffer6a143&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer\">transport</a>, <a href=\"https://theodi.org/agriculture-nutrition-open-data\">agriculture</a>, or housing to help build a data economy that works for everyone. </p>\n<p><em><strong>See the full response below, and access it <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1315562VjY1nMSAk4LNRhAPEBLGH0525e15dTMalDoco/edit#\">here</a>.

The G8 Open Data Charter also requires a National Action Plan, and we are assuming that this National Action Plan is intended to address those commitments as well as those from OGP.</p>\n<p>Section 1 of the National Action Plan focuses on Open Data and Transparency. It is not clear if the definition of “open data” that is used within this draft is the same as that defined in the Open Data White Paper, namely data that is accessible, available in a machine-readable format, and available under an open licence. The emphasis in the draft is on access to information, not on the ability to reuse it.</p>\n<p>We would like the National Action Plan to use the same definition of “open data” as is used in the Open Data White Paper, and to ensure that it is clear when a commitment is about providing basic access to information or enabling <em>reuse</em> of data.</p>\n<p>We are encouraged to see open data being used as policy tool in an increasingly wide and diverse range of areas. Our main priority for open data for the UK is establishing the National Information Infrastructure, as an essential core capability. We believe other OGP members will also benefit from taking an infrastructural view of open data.</p>\n<p>We broadly agree with the commitments made in Section 1 which highlight the way in which open data can be used to facilitate and support transparency, but feel they should go further in detailing the actual commitment made, timescales and responsibilities. For example, we would like to see commitments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to engage with the OpenContracting project to develop standards for publishing contracts as open data, and for GDS to publish government contracts through Contract Finder against those standards by October 2015</li>\n<li>for The National Archives to publish through its Digital Records Infrastructure, as open data, the catalogue metadata about newly released historical government records as part of the transition from 30 to 20 years, as these are made available, and for previously released records by October 2015</li>\n<li>for the Register of Lobbyists to be published as open data from its first release</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In general, wherever there is an activity oriented around making government more transparent and accountable, there is benefit in identifying datasets that, through their release as open data, could support that activity. We would like the UK National Action Plan to contain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>clear stated commitments for <strong>releasing</strong> new open data, improving existing open data, or embedding open data publication into existing processes</li>\n<li>a commitment to issuing <strong>procurement guidance</strong> that embeds open data publication and reuse into newly contracted services</li>\n<li>a commitment to <strong>measuring</strong> the quality and quantity of open data that is released, for which we recommend the use of the ODI Open Data Certificates</li>\n<li>a commitment to <strong>review</strong> progress against those measures on a regular basis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given that the Transparency Team is leading the definition of the National Information Infrastructure, we think there is an opportunity for the National Action Plan to set out the success criteria for that activity. For ODI, the success of the initiative is whether the plan for National Information Infrastructure contains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>some designated datasets which contain identifiers and reference data for core national infrastructure such as schools and hospitals (see below)</li>\n<li>an indication for each of these datasets about the current level of publication against the ODI’s Open Data Certificate</li>\n<li>a realistic plan for each dataset for their eventual publication as Expert-level open data against the ODI’s Open Data Certificate including: - quantifying benefits (such as efficiency savings) to the wider public sector</li>\n<li>a business case for sustainable publication linked to those benefits</li>\n<li>a definition of the technical approach to publication, including which open standard formats will be used, and how identifiers will be resolved</li>\n<li>an engagement plan that ensures the data gets maximum used and is improved over time</li>\n<li>dated milestones towards an Expert-level open data release</li>\n<li>a process for embedding the publication of National Information Infrastructure datasets as part of the core public task of the organisations concerned</li>\n<li>a process by which other National Information Infrastructure datasets may be identified over time</li>\n<li>a set of metrics for National Information Infrastructure, and a plan for how these are measured and reviewed over time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To be consistent with the G8 Open Data Charter, we will be looking for datasets in the categories identified within that work, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Companies</strong> - registered companies, VAT registered companies, registered charities, non-domestic buildings</li>\n<li><strong>Crime and Justice</strong> - police forces, police stations, crimes (ie Home Office classification), prisons, courts, judges &amp; magistrates, case law</li>\n<li><strong>Earth observation</strong> - weather observation points, farms, fields, forests, river network, lakes, protected areas</li>\n<li><strong>Education</strong> - schools &amp; academies, higher education providers, nurseries, examination boards, qualifications</li>\n<li><strong>Energy and Environment</strong> - pollution measuring points, flood zones, power stations &amp; substations, power network</li>\n<li><strong>Finance and contracts</strong> - public sector bodies, contracts (framework and otherwise), spending categories</li>\n<li><strong>Geospatial</strong> - maps, addresses</li>\n<li><strong>Global Development</strong> - cadastral parcels, mines, oil platforms</li>\n<li><strong>Government Accountability and Democracy</strong> - parliaments, parliamentary seats, wards, polling stations, political parties, legislation, government departments &amp; arms-length bodies, civil service positions, local authorities</li>\n<li><strong>Health</strong> - hospitals, GP practices, dental surgeries, other health providers, treatments, medicines, illnesses</li>\n<li><strong>Science and Research</strong> - research institutes, research councils</li>\n<li><strong>Statistics</strong> - census regions (ie output areas)</li>\n<li><strong>Social mobility and welfare</strong> - social housing, benefits, taxes, job centres</li>\n<li><strong>Transport and Infrastructure</strong> - railways &amp; stations, bus stops, airports, ferry terminals, roads, driving test centres, vehicles, rail operators</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are important core datasets into which other datasets can reference for additional context. We note that some of these datasets may require work with local authorities to ensure that data is published in a way that enables easy aggregation.</p>\n<p>We hope that this early feedback helps you to publish another draft shortly for further iterative review and refinement.</p>","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/possible-paf-licence-revision.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/consultation-responses/possible-paf-licence-revision","slug":"possible-paf-licence-revision","title":"Possible PAF® Licence Revision","format":"timed_item","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:51:52+00:00","created_at":"2012-11-28T14:19:00+00:00","tag_ids":["consultation-response"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/consultation-response.json","web_url":null,"title":"consultation response","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=consultation-response","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/consultation-response","slug":"consultation-response"}}],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"excerpt":"Letter to the Possible PAF Licence Revision Consultation from the Open Data Institute: 26th October 2012","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"content":"<p><strong>Letter to the Possible PAF Licence Revision Consultation from the Open Data Institute: 26th October 2012</strong></p>\n<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>\n<p>We are writing in response to your call for opinions on the licensing terms and pricing for the Postcode Address File (PAF®). Please feel free to publish this response; we are also publishing it on our own website.</p>\n<p>The Open Data Institute is a new not-for-profit centre for innovation which aims to maximise the social, environmental and economic value of open data. We have £10m funding over the next five years from the Technology Strategy Board, part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which we will at least match through funding from commercial organisations. As well as raising open data capability in government and enterprise, we seek to support new, innovative start-ups that take advantage of open data in their products and services.</p>\n<p>We are responding to the PAF® licence consultation because the PAF® is both a key resource for direct use by existing and new businesses and a vital component of many other datasets that, were it not for the restrictive licensing of PAF®, could be released as open data. As such, changes to the licensing terms and pricing of PAF® have impacts far beyond its existing customer base.</p>\n<p>There is a real opportunity for the PAF® Advisory Board to create economic and social value by radically changing the way in which Royal Mail manages this asset, which is vital not only to Royal Mail but to the country as a whole. We would challenge you to take up this opportunity and press for Royal Mail to release PAF® as open data and we would like to meet with the PAF® Advisory Board, or a relevant working group, to discuss this response.</p>\n<p>Yours faithfully,</p>\n<p>Gavin Starks<br />\n CEO</p>\n<p><strong>Q1 In the interests of simplicity and of fairness do you favour significantly changing the terms and conditions for the supply of PAF®?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. In the interests of both simplicity and fairness, we favour changing the terms and conditions for PAF® such that it is available as open data: made available for free and without restriction on how it is used.</p>\n<p><strong>Q2 How should the costs of reliable and up-to-date PAF® data be shared?</strong></p>\n<p>For the Royal Mail, maintaining a reliable and up-to-date PAF® is a necessary cost of doing business: Royal Mail could not deliver mail without it. Royal Mail should be enabled to recover those costs through charging those who wish to have mail delivered to their properties such as property developers who build new properties and demolish old ones, and both individuals and companies who wish to receive mail.</p>\n<p>Royal Mail will also save money compared to their current approach by releasing PAF® as open data, as the simpler model of dissemination will be more straightforward technically and not require as many sales or legal staff to be employed by them.</p>\n<p><strong>Q3 How might the pricing arrangements be developed to stimulate PAF® usage in the economy without adverse effects on data quality or the incentive to Royal Mail to develop PAF® data further?</strong></p>\n<p>Delivering PAF® free for commercial and non-commercial reuse will have positive direct and indirect effects on the economy as a whole. Firstly, it will enable new and existing businesses to take advantage of PAF® without the current financial and legal burdens they endure. Secondly, and more importantly, it means that data derived from information within PAF® will be freed for reuse, which will again stimulate new and old businesses to work more efficiently and effectively with address information.</p>\n<p>The PAF® Advisory Board should not underestimate the enormous \u0002effect that the PAF®'s restrictive licensing has on open-data availability within the UK as a whole. The <a href=\"http://www.adresse-info.dk/Portals/2/Benefit/Value_Assessment_Danish_Address_Data_UK_2010-07-07b.pdf\">release of the Danish address data as open data</a> in has led to a return on investment of 31:1 for direct usage over the first four years (on a spend of €2m) and a return on investment of 70:1 on use in 2010 (on a spend of €0.2m). These figures do not factor in indirect benefits to the economy (from further reusers of the data), and they illustrate how maintenance costs have decreased over time.</p>\n<p>With the additional use and importance of PAF®, Royal Mail should be able to find willing and trustworthy partners who will also care about developing PAF® and improving its data quality. Royal Mail could develop these partnerships to reduce Royal Mail's maintenance costs by shouldering some of those costs themselves.</p>\n<p>As proof of this model, we encourage the PAF Board to look at the Expert Participation Programme being run from The National Archives which will bring the government's legislation database up to date — massively improving its data quality in a way that The National Archives cannot do on its own — with assistance from commercial companies, government departments, academic institutions and others. This model is predicated on the availability of legislation as open data, as partners know that their contributions will be freely accessible forever.</p>\n<p><strong>Q4 Should Royal Mail continue to develop transactional pricing options and should there be a difference between the price for internal purposes (within the organisation) and external usage (through a public facing web site)?</strong></p>\n<p>Royal Mail should concentrate on:<br />\n \u0002</p>\n<ul>\n<li>bringing down the cost of maintaining PAF®, through technical and process improvement</li>\n<li>increasing its in-house capabilities on publishing open data</li>\n<li>partnering with organisations that can contribute to PAF®’s maintenance</li>\n<li>developing charging models for updates to the database</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It should not spend money on developing restrictive licensing and pricing options for the reuse of PAF® data, which limit the potential economic and social value that opening the data could unlock.</p>\n<p><strong>Q5 Do you wish to make any observations about the Government move to negotiate a centrally paid flat fee for non-commercial public sector use?</strong></p>\n<p>The public sector is one of many potential partners who rely upon PAF® to carry out their day-to-day work. The Royal Mail should cultivate this partnership to ensure that Government is able to effectively contribute to the maintenance of PAF®, supporting its release as open data.</p>\n<p>If PAF® is not released as open data, the restrictions on the licensing of data derived from PAF® currently restrict Government's ability to effectively implement its Open Data policies. A flat fee for public sector use should include the ability for Government to publish data derived from PAF® as open data.</p>\n<p><strong>Q6 How might these differences [in requirements regarding timeliness for reusers] be represented in the provision of PAF® without disproportionately complicating the licence conditions? Should the most frequent updating command a premium fee?</strong></p>\n<p>From our experience, it seems likely that the easiest way of implementing open access to PAF® would be to provide direct access to the data as currently stored within the database through an API. Dumps of the entire database might also be provided on a daily or weekly basis, coupled with feeds of changes that enable others to keep their versions synchronised with that held by Royal Mail. All these types of access (API, dumps and feeds of changes) should be available as open data, with no fee associated with them.</p>\n<p><strong>Q7 What frequency of updating would best suit your usage?</strong></p>\n<p>Most of our required uses of PAF® would be best satisfied through API access, which is most easily implemented through direct access to current data.</p>\n<p><strong>Q8 What are your views on:  \n \u0002(a) Direct end-user licensing;  \n \u0002(b) Solutions Providers paying licence fees on behalf of their customers based on a simple banding of end users’ potential use leaving PAF® free at the point of use;  \n \u0002(c) Unchanged arrangements?</strong></p>\n<p>All these complex licensing options are the result of PAF® not being available as open data. When choosing between these options, Royal Mail should demonstrate how any of these options leads to a more efficient and effective dissemination and use of PAF®, and more economic benefit to the UK, than its release as open data.</p>\n<p><strong>Q9 Which [licensing] approach do you favour?</strong></p>\n<p>Short, simple licences significantly reduce the barriers to reusing data, particularly by those organisations who cannot afford high legal costs. Open licences tend to be short and simple. We favour an open licence, such as the <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/\">UK Open Government Licence</a>, which is two pages long.</p>\n<p>We also observe that the complexity of the PAF® licence has a direct impact on the ability of those deriving data from PAF® to work out the limits on their onward licensing of that derived data, and thus has an adverse impact on much potential open data publication within the UK.</p>\n<p><strong>Q10 Are there other ways in which the UK generic licence could be simplified?</strong></p>\n<p>If PAF® is not released under an open licence, we recommend that Royal Mail join the Information Fair Trader Scheme, run by the Office of Public Sector Information within The National Archives, through which they can get advice about how to simplify their licence terms.</p>\n<p><strong>Q11 How should the definition of a user (currently ‘an individual work station or terminal or hand-held or otherwise portable device internal to the End-User’) be amended in the light of technological developments?</strong></p>\n<p>We have no response to this question, but observe that it illustrates the disproportionate effort that must be spent constructing licences that restrict access to, and usage of, PAF®. This effort would be better spent facilitating open access to PAF®.</p>\n<p><strong>Q12 To what extent should potential disruption and extra costs of adjustment to new arrangements inhibit Royal Mail from making changes?</strong></p>\n<p>The impacts of even small changes to licensing conditions are disruptive because they require legal assistance to assess the impact on existing businesses. In contrast, the impacts of adopting an open licence are clear to all concerned, and although potentially disruptive to existing businesses, provide many opportunities for new businesses and thus for economic growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Q13 Currently licensing arrangements have a 3 year minimum term with annual renewal. Does this meet your requirements or how should it be amended?</strong></p>\n<p>We have no response to this question.</p>\n<p><strong>Q14 If only minimal amendments were to be made to the existing licence what would be your priorities for change?</strong></p>\n<p>We have no response to this question.</p>\n<p><strong>Q15 What suggestions do you wish to make to improve contact between the Board and the market for PAF®?</strong></p>\n<p>We would recommend that the Board appoint a member from the start-up / SME community to represent potential reusers of PAF® who currently may not use it due to legal and financial barriers. We would welcome meeting with the Board to help them identify potential members in this group.</p>","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/postcode-address-file-ofcom.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/consultation-responses/postcode-address-file-ofcom","slug":"postcode-address-file-ofcom","title":"Postcode Address File (Ofcom)","format":"timed_item","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:51:58+00:00","created_at":"2013-02-09T12:05:09+00:00","tag_ids":["consultation-response"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/consultation-response.json","web_url":null,"title":"consultation response","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=consultation-response","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/consultation-response","slug":"consultation-response"}}],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"excerpt":"Thank you for the opportunity to feed into the consideration of what to do with the Postal Address File in future.

It is difficult to see how that is operating without being able to see the year on year costs but as there is a largely captive market the incentives are for short-termism – long-term investments that reduce the cost base, reduce the profit which can be taken. There is no incentive to open up new markets as maximum profits are already being extracted.</p>\n<p>We think a better way for this national asset to be maintained is for it to be held openly for free commercial reuse with a charge made for additions to the database (e.g. as part of the planning process). This would address the concerns we would have over incentives by encouraging maximum use of the data and getting Royal Mail to focus on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>bringing down the cost of maintaining PAF®, through technical and process improvement</li>\n<li>partnering with organisations that can contribute to its maintenance</li>\n<li>developing charging models for updates to the database</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ability to take cost out by collaborating on maintenance should not be underestimated.

The ODI supports the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fdata.gov.uk%2Fblog%2Fnational-address-dataset-benefits&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFGel-HjJbxvHGnnIpUZ8lycI-Y1w\">Open Data User Group’s (ODUG’s) case for an Open National Address Database</a> and believes that the Postcode Address File (PAF) should be made available as open data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"question31wewelcomeviewsfromstakeholdersonwhetherthesettingofqualitytargetsforpafwouldbeconstructiveifsowouldstakeholdersfindthepublicationofachievementagainstthosetargetshelpfulpleasestatewhy\">Question 3.1: We welcome views from stakeholders on whether the setting of quality targets for PAF would be constructive. If so, would stakeholders find the publication of achievement against those targets helpful? Please state why.</h3>\n<p>Providing metrics that indicate the quality of PAF would be useful for those who use it, as it would help them to assess PAF’s coverage and reliability compared to other sources of address information. Examples of useful metrics might be PAF’s coverage of UK addresses, the average time it takes to add a new delivery point to PAF, and the average time since each delivery point was last validated.</p>\n<p>Providing information about the changing quality of PAF over time would help in providing solid evidence about the impact of any changes to licensing terms and conditions, and means of cost recovery.</p>\n<p>In both cases, open publication of metrics and scores against those metrics would provide more useful information than simple indications of whether or not targets had been achieved. While obviously better quality data is better, it is more important, from a data consumer’s point of view, to be honest about the quality of data, especially where this can be used to focus effort, than to achieve arbitrary targets.</p>\n<p>We note that the required quality of PAF for the purpose of delivering mail is substantially different to the required quality of PAF as a source of addressing data, because of its focus on delivery points. However, PAF is the canonical source of information about the assignment of postcodes to addresses and as such is a prerequisite to a more useful and universal Open National Address Database.</p>\n<h3 id=\"question61dostakeholdersagreewithouranalysisoftheoptionsforcostrecoveryagainsttheprinciplesofcostcausationandourproposaloncostrecoverypleasegivereasonsforyourresponse\">Question 6.1: Do stakeholders agree with our analysis of the options for cost recovery against the principles of cost causation, and our proposal on cost recovery? Please give reasons for your response.</h3>\n<p>Ofcom’s argument for retaining the current mechanism for cost recovery overlooks several factors which we believe should lead it to different conclusions.</p>\n<h4 id=\"alternativestopaf\">Alternatives to PAF</h4>\n<p>In paragraphs 3.25-3.26, Ofcom cites the PAF Advisory Board’s (PAB’s) study into possible alternatives to PAF to conclude that there are not likely to be any alternatives to PAF in the near future.</p>\n<p>At ODI, we have heard anecdotal reports of developers using Google’s geocoding service to perform free postcode lookups. We understand that Google’s postcode data is created based on gathering published postcodes from the web. We believe that, particularly as more data is published on the web, constructing a postcode database through published data becomes much more feasible.</p>\n<p>We would encourage Ofcom to consider the possibility of alternatives to PAF being generated through web-enabled mechanisms, both gathering data from the web and web-based collaboration of the sort seen within OpenStreetMaps.</p>\n<h4 id=\"thecostbase\">The cost base</h4>\n<p>The graph shown on p.13 demonstrates that over the last five years, Royal Mail has not managed to make any efficiency savings in its maintenance of PAF. This is in some ways astounding, given the transformations and developments that have occurred in that time frame in mobile, web, and data technologies, which would seem to be relevant to the maintenance of PAF.</p>\n<p>On the other hand it is not surprising: the mechanism of the percentage cap on profits on PAF has not led to efficiency savings, as any savings that Royal Mail were to make would lead to a decrease in their profits in real terms, which they are bound to avoid.</p>\n<p>There does seem to be evidence here of potential producer surplus (ie that Royal Mail is selling access to PAF for more money than the least they would prepared to sell it for), which argues for intervention by Ofcom.</p>\n<h4 id=\"recoveringthecostsofpaf\">Recovering the costs of PAF</h4>\n<p>The Ofcom analysis contains many good arguments why PAF should be released as open data, but also overlooks several points, resulting in the wrong conclusion.</p>\n<p>On <strong>cost causation</strong>: the Ofcom analysis rightly argues that the majority of the costs of PAF are incurred through Royal Mail fulfilling its primary task of delivering mail. While the figures have been redacted, we can surmise from paragraphs 4.5-4.6 that the significant majority of the costs of PAF are internal costs, and that the majority of the external costs are based on supporting licensing. If PAF were available as open data, downloadable from the web, these external costs would be minimal.</p>\n<p>On <strong>cost minimisation</strong>: we agree with the Ofcom analysis that Royal Mail would have more incentive to reduce its costs in maintaining PAF if it were being funded from its Reported Business.</p>\n<p>On <strong>effective competition and reciprocity</strong>: if PAF were open data, Royal Mail would be able to use a distributed, collaborative model for maintaining PAF, whereby those who rely on PAF (Local Authorities, other mail distributors, government departments and so on) would be motivated to contribute to its maintenance. (This is known as <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FCommons-based_peer_production&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFVJZ-86rurXYZK08q9Hy3kK1KjAg\">commons-based peer production</a>.) These contributions might be in-kind contributions of software, hardware or services, or could be in the form of corrections and new information that keep PAF up to date. New models of collaborative distributed value creation are enabled by by open data and the web, as demonstrated in open source software, and in open data such as OpenStreetMap, Wikipedia, MusicBrainz and legislation.gov.uk.</p>\n<p>On <strong>distribution of benefits</strong>: the PAB review indicated that 40% of the benefits of PAF arose from postal and goods distribution services. This compares to the analysis from that report, replicated in Figure 5.1 of the Ofcom consultation, which shows that “wholesale &amp; distribution (including mail operators)” contribute just 3.6% of licence revenues. The discrepancy between these figures indicates that mail distributors are currently receiving a far higher percentage of the benefits from PAF than they are contributing towards.</p>\n<p>On <strong>practicability</strong>: as the consultation indicates, in the long term it is most practical for the PAF to be made available as open data, distributed through the web.</p>\n<p>The conclusion drawn by Ofcom in paragraphs 6.20-6.22 is essentially that since Royal Mail is unable to make its core business, of delivering mail, profitable, it should continue to be able to subsidise that business by selling access to PAF.</p>\n<p>Ofcom should not pollute the decision about the way in which PAFs costs should be recovered by the current owner of PAF, with consideration about Royal Mail’s profitability as a business. Further, it should not count the profits that AMU makes by selling PAF as profits for Royal Mail: that money should have been channelled into improvements to PAF itself, in its quality, its provision and in investment to produce long term efficiency savings. The reason PAF has a separate regulated cost base and regulatory regime is presumably to avoid Royal Mail from extracting excess profits from PAF.</p>\n<p>Subsidising Royal Mail’s core business using PAF licences is not sustainable, given the alternatives that are likely to emerge in the near future (as described above). As Ofcom’s consultation notes, PAF licence sales make up only around 0.4% of revenues to Royal Mail, so it seems unwise for Ofcom to recommend that Royal Mail continues to rely on selling PAF to retain its ongoing profitability.</p>\n<p>We encourage Ofcom to consider a future in which the Address Management Unit (AMU) is a non-profit organisation, separate from Royal Mail, and Royal Mail must interact with it on an equal footing with other mail operators.</p>\n<p>What cost recovery mechanisms should AMU put in place in that case? As discussed above, we suggest a business model based on open data, where AMU offers paid-for services and support for using that data, and cuts costs by partnering with key organisations who can contribute to PAF’s maintenance.</p>\n<p>In paragraph 6.23, the Ofcom consultation states that Ofcom’s general duties to the interests of citizens and consumers are furthered by retaining the status quo, and that their recommendations will increase innovation and investment. These statements are questionable and are not backed up with evidence.</p>\n<p>We would encourage Ofcom to seek out evidence on the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aside from creating more complex licensing terms, what innovation and investment has there been, by Royal Mail, in the maintenance and provision of PAF, over the last five years?</li>\n<li>What usages of PAF have been ruled out due to PAF’s cost, complex licensing terms and the difficulty of accessing PAF data?</li>\n<li>What would the demand for PAF be if it were free?</li>\n<li>What would impact be on the ability for other public sector data to be made available as open data?</li>\n<li>What would the overall (UK-wide) economic impact be were PAF to be made available as open data?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Contrary to the lack of evidence cited in paragraph 6.25, the Open Data Institute has evidence from multiple sources that the current pricing of PAF has reduced its take up, and would be pleased to work with Ofcom to explore the ways in which PAF could be used more widely, and for the general good of citizens and consumers, were it available as open data.</p>\n<p>In summary, we do not agree with Ofcom’s analysis about the options for cost recovery. In particular, we feel that Ofcom has overlooked collaborative options for cost recovery that are well suited to the web, and that are enabled by open data, and that this should be rectified.</p>\n<h3 id=\"question71dostakeholdersagreewithourproposedapproachtothetermsonwhichpafismadeavailableandourguidanceonthosetermspleasegivereasonsforyourresponse\">Question 7.1: Do stakeholders agree with our proposed approach to the terms on which PAF is made available, and our guidance on those terms? Please give reasons for your response.</h3>\n<p>We agree with the proposed principles for the new PAF licensing framework, laid out in paragraph 7.8, and note that these are most easily satisfied by adopting open data.</p>\n<p>We agree with Ofcom’s analysis that the current model of capping profits as a percentage of costs does not work to encourage either efficiency savings or the greater take-up or development of PAF by Royal Mail. We understand Ofcom’s caution in proposing an alternative while Royal Mail is reviewing its current licensing framework.</p>\n<p>In providing guidance on ‘reasonable’ terms, we would encourage Ofcom to consider what is reasonable from the perspective of the economy as a whole, as PAF is essential information infrastructure for the UK. We would also encourage Ofcom to separate the provision of PAF from the provision of universal mail delivery. As we have argued above, PAF should not be used to subsidise Royal Mail’s mail delivery business.</p>","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/proposed-amendments-individual-pupil-information-prescribed-persons.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/consultation-responses/proposed-amendments-individual-pupil-information-prescribed-persons","slug":"proposed-amendments-individual-pupil-information-prescribed-persons","title":"Proposed Amendments to Individual Pupil Information Prescribed Persons Regulations","format":"timed_item","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:51:53+00:00","created_at":"2012-11-28T15:00:04+00:00","tag_ids":["consultation-response"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/consultation-response.json","web_url":null,"title":"consultation response","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=consultation-response","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/consultation-response","slug":"consultation-response"}}],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"excerpt":"1.

Do you agree with the proposal to widen the purposes for which data from the National Pupil Database can be shared? Please explain the reasons for your answer.</strong></p>\n<p>Disagree</p>\n<p>The ODI supports the release of open data: data free for unrestricted use. It also supports the collection and careful analysis of data that can contribute to evidence-based policy formation.</p>\n<p>The ODI does not support the release of personal data as open data, or the use of personal data for commercial ends in the absence of affected individuals being both</p>\n<ul>\n<li>informed of that use; and</li>\n<li>giving explicit consent</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This proposal does not include the publication of open data: although organisations will not have to pay for the data, the Department for Education has stringent restrictions over its access.</p>\n<p>The proposal widens the set of purposes for which data about individual pupils can be made available in two ways: the goal of the reuse (to improve children’s well-being as well as promoting their education) and the beneficiaries of the results (to commercial organisations providing information and data-based products as well as researchers). The ODI supports the former but not the latter, and would support the change to the wording of the regulation if it said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>persons conducting research into the well-being or educational achievements of children in England and who require individual pupil information for that purpose</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As well as the regulation itself, the Department for Education maintains a separate set of terms and conditions for the use of the National Pupil Database; any requests for the data are assessed by the Data and Statistics Division and the Data Management Advisory Panel against both the regulation and the terms. We understand that the terms organisations sign up to state that recipients of the data must not attempt to identify individuals within the dataset; organisations who have access to the data are subject to the Data Protection Act and breaching the terms would expose those organisations to prosecution, negative publicity and substantial financial penalties. However, commercial organisations take calculated risks, and if the likelihood of detection of breaches of terms is low (or the company able to absorb any penalties), and the benefits high, we believe there is a high risk that they will break those terms of use.</p>\n<p>We are concerned that the level of anonymisation used within the data extracts created from the National Pupil Database is not sufficient to prevent personal data from being discovered about individuals held within the database. For example, the year of birth, school attended and subjects taken (and grades achieved) of an individual are often easily locatable through an individual’s CV, and act as a fingerprint for an individual within the database, enabling their record to be identified even when “identifiable” information is omitted.</p>\n<p>We believe that the Data and Statistics Division and the Data Management Advisory Panel will do their best to safeguard the hundreds of thousands of children and young people whose personal details are stored within this database. However, the fact is that the more widely the data is distributed, the more likely it is that a security breach will occur. The number of people affected by such a breach, and the amount of information that would be made available about them, make the proposed widened availability too much of a risk.</p>\n<p>We also do not see any evidence in the consultation for extra steps being taken to inform parents, children and young people about each additional use of the data, nor provision to obtain individual consent about this use. We believe informed consent should be a prerequisite for commercial use of personal data and we do not believe that there is any implied consent to such usage for the data that is currently held within the National Pupil Database. Our response to Question 4 below describes the measures we believe the Department for Education should put into place to obtain this consent if the National Pupil Database is made available for commercial purposes.</p>\n<p>In addition, we believe that the media and the public will perceive the widened usage of the National Pupil Database as an example of the government carrying through its Open Data policy objectives. Although the proposal does not make the National Pupil Database available as open data, the distinction between \"open data\" and \"free data you have to apply to access\" is rather subtle, particularly when it is justified in the same way (to promote economic growth through the development of the information industry). We are concerned that negative publicity and feeling about commercial usage of this data, particularly if there were a security breach, will have a negative knock-on effect on attitudes towards open data, which would set back our own work and impact other global initiatives that are driving positive change.</p>\n<p>The National Pupil Database does contain data that could be useful for third-party applications (see the response to Question 2 below). However, the vast majority of these applications can be created based on aggregate data from which (if appropriately treated to control levels of disclosure) it is harder to identify individuals.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we believe that the individual-level data within the National Pupil Database should remain restricted in its availability, and the scope of the purposes for which the data can be shared should remain limited to research, but with the widened goal of pupil well being. We do, however, encourage the Department for Education to release more detailed aggregation data than it currently makes available, as open data.</p>\n<p><strong>2. How could you or your organisation potentially use the data?</strong></p>\n<p>The Open Data Institute supports start-ups and other data consumers to discover and use open data. There are a number of uses to which aggregations derived from the National Pupil Database could be put. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>property-finder applications could use school-level aggregations of attainment in individual subjects to help parents find a school or nursery that is suitable to their child’s individual strengths and weaknesses</li>\n<li>property-finder applications could use an aggregation based on pupil addresses to identify the implicit catchment area of a school, which would help parents identify where to move to get into a particular school</li>\n<li>a service could be created that matched schools based on their intake and enabled them to share best practices to help drive up the quality of teaching within schools</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The aggregations these applications require could be generated by the Department for Education. None of these services require access to individual-level data.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What do you see as the benefits of widening the purposes for which data can be shared?</strong></p>\n<p>We can see that there are many potential benefits in widening the purposes for which individual-level data from the National Pupil Database can be shared in a secure way (not as open data), particularly for the organisations who could gain insight by having access to the data, leading to better targetting of products and services and to internal efficiencies. But we see many risks in providing that access, particularly to commercial organisations, as described in our answer to Question 1, and feel these outweigh the benefits.</p>\n<p>We also see great benefits, which crucially do not have the same risks, in providing as open data suitably anonymised aggregate information sourced from the National Pupil Database. This could lead to economic growth, as new businesses are built on top of the available data, as well as social and environmental benefit if services are developed that enhance the teaching provided to children and the environmental impact of the schools.</p>\n<p>We also see benefits in enabling researchers to have access to the data to research children’s well-being (not just their educational achievement). Such research could help inform evidence-based policy by identifying interventions that will benefit children and young people in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Do you have any other comments you would like to make about the proposals in this consultation document?</strong></p>\n<p>If the Department for Education follows through on this proposal to widen the purposes of use of the National Pupil Database, it will need to invest additional resources in the approvals process around requests for access, including</p>\n<ul>\n<li>assessing the security controls in the companies making these requests</li>\n<li>ongoing audits of the technical and procedural measures that are put into place within the Department and those companies</li>\n<li>preventing and dealing with security breaches</li>\n<li>prosecuting organisations that breach the terms of use</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We think that these resources would be better spent in building a robust mechanism for publishing useful low-level aggregate data from the National Pupil Database as open data. Publishing open data would enable new companies to easily use the aggregate data to create the kinds of services described in our answer to Question 2, reducing the workload both on those companies and Department for Education staff.</p>\n<p>As part of the UK Anonymisation Network, the ODI would be very interested in exploring, with the Department for Education and some of the startups that we are currently incubating, how such aggregate data could be created without exposing personal information.</p>\n<p>If the Department for Education decides to continue with the proposal to widen the purposes for which the National Pupil Database is made available, we would encourage the Department for Education to consult with the UK Anonymisation Network and explore methods of limiting the personal information that is made available to companies that make it through the approvals process.</p>\n<p>The Department for Education should make available as open data the details of who has access to information from the National Pupil Database, which information they have access to, and for what purposes.</p>\n<p>The Department for Education should seek the consent of the children and young people whose details are made available (or their parents), for the new uses to which the data will be put. This consent should be granted for the widened use of the data, particularly with an increase of scope to commercial purposes (previous consent for the purpose of research should not be taken as implied consent). Consent should be sought for all those affected, not just the current cohort of school and nursery children.</p>\n<p>It is unlikely that companies will be interested in all the data held by the National Pupil Database; to limit exposure, the Department for Education should continue to only make available to companies the information that they need (which may involve subsetting the data to particular records and/or only releasing requested fields for those records)</p>\n<p><strong>5. Please let us have your views on responding to this consultation (e.g. the number and type of questions, whether it was easy to find, understand, complete etc.).</strong></p>\n<p>The ODI is extremely grateful for the opportunity to respond to this consultation, and thanks the Department for Education for alerting us to it. We would encourage future consultations to enable responses through a web form, to facilitate the submission of responses through third-party websites and the capture of those responses. We would also encourage the republication of consultation responses as open data (subject to permission from the responder).</p>","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/public-consultations.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/public-consultations","slug":"public-consultations","title":"Public consultations","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-05-17T15:20:09+00:00","created_at":"2014-09-26T13:18:00+00:00","tag_ids":["page","policy","policies","consultation-response","consultation","data-infrastructure"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/page.json","web_url":null,"title":"Page","details":{"description":"Page","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=page","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/page","slug":"page"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/policy.json","web_url":null,"title":"policy","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=policy","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/policy","slug":"policy"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/policies.json","web_url":null,"title":"policies","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=policies","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/policies","slug":"policies"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/consultation-response.json","web_url":null,"title":"consultation response","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=consultation-response","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/consultation-response","slug":"consultation-response"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/consultation.json","web_url":null,"title":"consultation","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=consultation","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/consultation","slug":"consultation"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/data-infrastructure.json","web_url":null,"title":"data infrastructure","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=data-infrastructure","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/data-infrastructure","slug":"data-infrastructure"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"Our policy activities provide leadership on emerging data issues and challenge ways people and organisations communicate about data.

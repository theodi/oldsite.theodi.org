Data protection and IP rights in data are coordinated by other departments. The responsibility for all aspects of data policy should lie in one place within the Cabinet Office, and be more clearly aligned with digital service delivery. The Information Commissioner’s Office should oversee regimes governing both access to and reuse of public information, and be supported to continue to improve its services. The data strategy should cover data owned by central and local government, other public bodies and organisations outside government, wherever possible.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/86/d8/5486d824d0d46207f0000011/blue_break.png\">\n    <h4>Give the framework oversight and political attention: appoint a Chief Data Officer, who, as part of their role, will monitor and seek the publication of open data</h4>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A government data strategy needs strong strategic leadership. A Chief Data Officer position created within the Cabinet Office should be provided with budget and a team to develop, advocate for and seek progress on all aspects of the UK’s data strategy. The Chief Data Officer position would report to the Executive Director of Digital in the Cabinet Office, explicitly aligning data as part of the government’s ‘digital by default’ strategy. The Chief Data Officer should be able to compel the release of data as high-quality, open data from public bodies, where it is in the public interest to do so.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/86/d8/5486d824d0d46207f0000011/blue_break.png\">\n    <h4>Combine policy with delivery: support the Government Digital Service to develop a world-class data publishing platform for use by the public sector</h4>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Government Digital Service is transforming online government services, and making it easier to find information about government. Similar attention should be paid to embedding high-quality data publication into all digital services across government. The GDS is best placed to exercise this role. GOV.UK and the Office of National Statistics website should be invested in to enhance high-quality open data publication. \n</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <a href=\"http://theodi.org/roadmap-uk-2015-step2\"><u class=\"pull-right\">next</u></a>\n    <p></p>\n      <img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/86/d8/5486d824d0d46207f0000011/blue_break.png\">\n    <h2>The roadmap</h2>\n <p></p>\n    <ul class=\"grid effect-2 listing\" id=\"grid2\">\n      <li class=\"home-module\">\n        <div class=\"module-event\">\n          <a href=\"http://theodi.org/roadmap-uk-2015-step1\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/64/548764df1f986a0882000020/1.png\"></a>\n      </li>\n      <li class=\"home-module\">\n        <div class=\"module-event\">\n          <a href=\"http://theodi.org/roadmap-uk-2015-step2\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/66/548766d31f986a0882000022/2.png\"></a>\n        </div>\n     </li>\n     <li class=\"home-module\">\n        <div class=\"module-event\">\n          <a href=\"http://theodi.org/roadmap-uk-2015-step3\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/65/548765afd0d46207f0000031/3.png\"></a>\n        </div>\n     </li>\n   </ul>\n </div>\n</div>\n <div class=\"pull-left col-md-3\">\n    <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document_downloads/249768188?extension=pdf&from=embed&source=embed\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/67/54876771d0d46207f0000037/download.png\" alt=\"\"></a>\n    <p></p>\n    <h3>Roadmap steps</h3>\n    <p></p>\n          <a href=\"http://theodi.org/roadmap-uk-2015-step1\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/68/54876819d0d46207f000003b/step1.png\"></a>\n    <p></p>   \n          <a href=\"http://theodi.org/roadmap-uk-2015-step2\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/67/54876776d0d46207f0000039/step2.png\"></a>\n    <p></p>   \n          <a href=\"http://theodi.org/roadmap-uk-2015-step2\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/68/54876819f362be08ee000031/step3.png\"></a>\n    <p></p>   \n    <img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/6f/54876f1bf362be08ee000033/carbon.png\">\n  </div>\n</div>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

The report uses this definition to explore how the ways in which weather and climate data are accessed, used and shared are evolving.</p>\n<p>Reviewing weather data’s importance, and the steps in its value chain, we draw attention to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the evolving role of global, regional and national meteorological services in collecting observations and generating forecasts</li>\n<li>the technology trends creating new data assets along with new big data challenges</li>\n<li>the growing need for investment in technical infrastructure and supercomputing resources to drive improvements in forecasting, and the pressure this puts on ensuring sustainable access to data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Analysing key technology trends and their impacts is important to understanding how weather data infrastructure is evolving. In studying these drivers we hope to encourage discussion around how our global weather data infrastructure can be sustainable and continue to bring significant value to society, while remaining as open as possible.</p>\n<p><em><strong>This report was produced by the Open Data Institute (ODI) in collaboration with the <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/\">Met Office</a></strong></em></p>\n<iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/345725803/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&show_recommendations=true\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"undefined\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_99389\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/supporting-sustainable-development-with-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/supporting-sustainable-development-with-open-data","slug":"supporting-sustainable-development-with-open-data","title":"Supporting sustainable development with open data","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-10-31T15:11:17+00:00","created_at":"2015-02-10T16:40:53+00:00","tag_ids":["page","whitepaper","research","sustainable","development"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/how-improve-agriculture-food-nutrition-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/how-improve-agriculture-food-nutrition-open-data","slug":"how-improve-agriculture-food-nutrition-open-data","title":"Improving agriculture and nutrition with open data","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:03:21+00:00","created_at":"2015-05-27T13:07:37+00:00","tag_ids":["page","global-development","food","godan","nutrition","agritech","agriculture","discussion-paper"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}}

Two <a href=\"http://theodi.org/start-ups\" title=\"ODI Startup\">ODI Startup</a> cohorts now employ over 70 people and have generated over £4m income and new investment. </p>\n<p>Over 20 <a href=\"http://theodi.org/nodes\" title=\"ODI Nodes\">ODI Nodes</a> in our emerging franchise network operate across 15 countries, and have generated £0.5m in their first year. This year we trained over 700 people, including our first cohort of trainers, reached over 500,000 people and held over 80 events. </p>\n<p>We have also crystallised our own positioning as an Institute: \nour <strong>Global Network</strong> (members, trainers, nodes) are steering us \nto become their professional body. Our <strong>Innovation Unit</strong> delivers the services, evidence and R&amp;D needed to create impact, develops policy and runs our startup programme. </p>\n<p>These are underpinned by <strong>ODI Core</strong> operations, who direct our strategy and culture, have supported doubling the number in our team, and manage both our physical and our digital presence.</p>\n<p>The ODI must be sustainable and deliver impact. Balancing our requirement for margin with the need to deliver our mission is critical. With the support of our team and community, I believe we have created a strong position. </p>\n<p>I am delighted with both the progress of the business, its direction and outputs, and the role its teams are playing in the development of open data culture in the UK and worldwide.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theodi.org/team/gavin-starks\" title=\"Gavin Starks\">Gavin Starks</a></strong></p>\n<hr />\n<iframe style=\"max-width:100%;\" class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/256142382/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=slideshow&amp;access_key=key-uPCP3YtDB5TWu4WdmMsR&amp;show_recommendations=false\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.661041819515774\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_39226\" width=\"500\" height=\"700\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"Get the Annual Report here","url":"https://www.scribd.com/document_downloads/256142382?extension=pdf&from=embed&source=embed"},{"title":"ODI's First Year: Annual Report","url":"http://theodi.org/odis-first-year-annual-report"}],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

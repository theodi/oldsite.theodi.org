Their first collaborative project together, Metrography showcases both their skills and interests, producing a complex yet accessible work that critically investigates the implications of technology.</p>\n<p>Benedikt is a speculative and interaction designer working across disciplines. He is fascinated by the relationships between people, their data and environments. This study has led to his belief that design, driven by an understanding of those relationships, can improve people’s lives. He is co-author of Generative Gestaltung which is one of the standard books for computational design and information visualization in German-language with translations to English and French.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://benedikt-gross.de/\">http://benedikt-gross.de/</a></p>\n<p>Bertrand is a multidisciplinary designer based in London, UK. He is interested in ideological differentials, cultural negatives, the spaces between fiction, history, hyperreality, and the depiction of their prospective implications for the real. In parallel, Bertrand also works a design consultant to help companies create compelling products and experiences for the global market.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bertrandclerc.com/\">http://bertrandclerc.com/</a></p>","organizations":[],"author":{},"image":{}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{}}

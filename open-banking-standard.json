When securely shared or published openly using open APIs, the data can be used to build useful applications and resources to help people find what they need. Customers can look for a mortgage more easily, banks can find customers matched to a new product, and businesses can share data with their accountants. This, in turn, will improve efficiency and stimulate innovation.</p>\n<p>In order to plan for this transformation, we set up the Open Banking Working Group in September 2015 – at the request of HM Treasury – to explore how data could be used to help people transact, save, borrow, lend and invest their money, and to ensure a standard was put in place to protect privacy and ensure the data is secure. As a result, the working group set out an <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/298568600/Introducing-the-Open-Banking-Standard\">Open Banking Standard</a> to guide how open banking data should be created, shared and used by its owners and those who access it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"getinvolvedwithopenbanking\">Get involved with open banking</h3>\n<p>Following our creation of the working group and the open banking standards, the Competition Markets Authority (CMA) has worked with a number of banks to release APIs of their data.

Thanks to <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/open-data-users/\"\">Transport for London</a> opening its data, a new wave of innovative transport apps were made possible. This is just one example of how open data has contributed to our everyday lives financially, socially, culturally and more. </p>\n<p>Open data impacts everybody. Through it we can improve how we access healthcare services, discover cures for diseases more efficiently, understand our governments better and, of course, travel to places more easily. New open data opportunities are constantly being discovered and we’re trying to encourage these discoveries. </p>\n<h3 id=\"whatisthedefinition\">What is the definition?</h3>\n<p>Open data is data that anyone can access, use or share. Simple as that. When big companies or governments release non-personal data, it enables small businesses, citizens and medical researchers to develop resources which make crucial improvements to their communities. </p>\n<p>Some of us worry about personal health records being “made open”. Some confuse commercial and personal data, or mix up big data with open data. It’s easily done. We’ve created <a href=\"https://theodi.org/data-spectrum\" title=\"this visual\">this visual</a> to show you the different types of data that exist out there. </p>\n<h3 id=\"thebenefitsofopendata\">The benefits of open data</h3>\n<p>Open data has proven benefits for our economies and citizens.

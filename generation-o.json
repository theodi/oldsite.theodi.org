We exist online and in every country, company, school and community.</p>\n<p>We shape our attitudes around <strong>open culture</strong>. We expect everything to be accessible: an open web, open source, open cities, open government, open innovation, open data. We believe in <strong>freedom</strong> to connect, freedom to travel, freedom to share and freedom to trade. Anyone can publish, anyone can broadcast, anyone can sell things, anyone can learn and everyone can share.</p>\n<p>With this open mindset we transform sectors around the world – from business to art – by promoting <strong>transparency, accessibility, innovation</strong> and <strong>collaboration</strong>.</p>\n<p>We believe in harnessing the power of the network and we make up more than the sum of our parts. We expect services, not products, whether from businesses, charities or governments. Our expectations are high: if a service isn’t good enough, we expect to be able to shape what is offered, or we’ll make our own.</p>\n<p>We use and produce <strong>open data</strong> in everyday applications, government policies, humanitarian initiatives and business solutions. It brings us insights and efficiencies; our efforts are united, not duplicated.</p>\n<p>We challenge ourselves and each other. We share our good times, our bad times, and our jogging times. We share information to fight injustice and corruption. We share our playlists. We map disaster zones to help target aid, and local schools for informed communities.</p>\n<p><strong>We are Generation Open</strong>. Together, we will unlock knowledge for everyone.</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"ODI Summit 2015","url":"http://summit.theodi.org"},{"title":"Open data awards 2015","url":"http://awards.theodi.org"}],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/generation-open-data-benefit-tim-berners-lee-nigel-shadbolt.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/generation-open-data-benefit-tim-berners-lee-nigel-shadbolt","slug":"generation-open-data-benefit-tim-berners-lee-nigel-shadbolt","title":"Paving the way for Generation Open: what it will take and who will benefit","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:02:45+00:00","created_at":"2015-07-28T10:00:11+00:00","tag_ids":["news","nigel-shadbolt","tim-berners-lee","data-specturm","business","gavin-starks"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

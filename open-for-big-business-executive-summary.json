This report explores three industry-leading enterprises that have embraced an open approach – open source, open standards, open data, open innovation – to help retain their competitive edge. </p>\n    <blockquote>“We’re becoming an open platform for our customers, a core piece of their operating infrastructure.”</blockquote>\n    <i>– <b>Tim Baker, Global Head of Content Strategy and Innovation, Thomson Reuters</b></i>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The three multinationals featured in this report are proving that ‘being open’ is about more than just taking advantage of data made open by governments, other businesses and community groups. These companies have adopted an open approach to keep pace with change, adapt to new markets and influence whole sectors. In effect, they are becoming porous – using an open approach as a mechanism to improve their services, take advantage of new ideas and opportunities, and grow and collaborate more with their networks.</p>\n    <p><b>Thomson Reuters</b>,<b> Arup </b>and<b> Syngenta </b>are embedding open principles into their operations to gain competitive advantage. All three are large-scale consumers of data, and sell data-based products. Today, the market for data – data itself, data services and platforms, and data analytics – is hyper competitive. Big businesses in every sector are asking themselves how they can use data more effectively to improve their operations. For Thomson Reuters, Arup and Syngenta, being open has become crucial for overcoming the challenges that many big businesses face:</p>\n    <ul class=\"small\">\n      <li><b>reusing third-party sources of data </b>to drive internal decision making and create new competitive products and services</li>\n      <li><b>maintaining a leadership position</b> in increasingly competitive markets</li>\n      <li><b>keeping costs low for the business</b> and for customers and partners they work with<b> </b></li>\n      <li><b>staying agile and ready to evolve</b> as the environment they operate in changes</li>\n      <li><b>collaborating</b><b> </b><b>with</b><b> clients, and even competitors,</b> to tackle sector-wide challenges</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h2>Case studies</h2>\n\n    <ul class=\"grid effect-2 listing\" id=\"grid2\">\n      <li class=\"home-module\">\n        <div class=\"module module-light module-colour-8\">\n          <a href=\"http://theodi.org/big-business-case-study-thomson-reuters\">\n            <h1 class=\"text-center\">Thomson Reuters</h1>\n          </a>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      <li class=\"home-module\">\n        <div class=\"module module-light module-colour-8\">\n          <a href=\"http://theodi.org/big-business-case-study-arup\">\n            <h1 class=\"text-center\">Arup</h1>\n          </a>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      <li class=\"home-module\">\n        <div class=\"module module-light module-colour-8\">\n          <a href=\"http://theodi.org/big-business-case-study-syngenta\">\n            <h1 class=\"text-center\">Syngenta</h1>\n          </a>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>Each of these businesses has addressed these kinds of challenges in a different way.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/big-business-case-study-thomson-reuters\" title=\"Case study: Thomson Reuters\">Thomson Reuters</a> has taken what started as an internal data management solution and <b>created a new, collaborative information platform providing open data that anyone can </b><b>access, use and share</b>.<b> </b>The team took this approach to improve client relationships, the quality of their data and uptake of their existing products.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/big-business-case-study-arup\" title=\"Case study: Arup\">Arup</a> has <b>created and connected with an ecosystem of open innovators</b>. Backed by a compelling business model, the team is reducing transactional friction between their customers’ challenges and their teams’ ability to address them, through a porous data supply-chain. This has led to new products and new ways of working, and saved them time and money.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/big-business-case-study-syngenta\" title=\"Case study: Syngenta\">Syngenta</a> started off <b>publishing open data to increase transparency </b>but soon realised that it could <b>help </b><b>them shift to a more open, or networked, approach to operating</b>. The team are determined to capitalise on the new relationships that this will create.</p>\n    <p>Each has used an <b>open approach as a mechanism to retain competitive advantage</b>. Whether by publishing open data or building an open ecosystem, they are developing trust, creating networks and nurturing fertile ground for future innovation.</p>\n\n    <a href=\"http://theodi.org/big-business-introduction\" title=\"Next page\"><img class=\"pull-right\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/16/43/56164300f362be08b400000f/summer_showcase_next_but.svg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"pull-left col-md-3\">\n    <div class=\"blog-box-opacity\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/open-for-big-business-executive-summary\" title=\"Summary: Open for big business\">Summary</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/open-for-big-business-introduction\" title=\"Introduction: Open for big business\">Introduction</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/open-for-big-business-case-study-thomson-reuters\" title=\"Case study - Thomson Reuters: Open for big business\">Case study: Thomson Reuters</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/open-for-big-business-case-study-arup\" title=\"Case study - Arup: Open for big business\">Case study: Arup</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/open-for-big-business-case-study-syngenta\" title=\"Case study - Syngenta: Open for big business\">Case study: Syngenta</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/open-for-big-business-open-approaches\" title=\"Open approaches: Open for big business\">Open approaches</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/open-for-big-business-big-open-businesses\" title=\"Open businesses: Open for big business\">Open businesses</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/open-for-big-business-appendices\" title=\"Appendices: Open for big business\">Appendices</a>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

Trainers may be requested to attend follow up review sessions on a periodic basis and be subject to monitoring. </p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"ODI Registered Trainer assessment criteria (Google Doc)","url":"https://docs.google.com/a/theodi.org/document/d/1nFwHGxHOeqSzf2kJlrMCAUPeZVwgXsLJgLJN_IBkdJo/edit"},{"title":"Open data courses and training","url":"http://theodi.org/courses"}],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/in-house-training.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/in-house-training","slug":"in-house-training","title":"In-house and customised training","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:56:32+00:00","created_at":"2014-07-24T15:37:54+00:00","tag_ids":["page"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{}}

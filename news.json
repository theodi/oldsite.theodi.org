By gathering information provided directly by people about addresses they know, and from open data sources, it will grow into an open address list for the UK, available to everyone as open data. </p>\n<p><strong>Use case</strong></p>\n<p>The need for a free, open address database has been well documented within <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/open-data-user-group\">Open Data User Group (ODUG)</a> business cases and in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/274979/bis-14-513-open-national-address-gazetteer.pdf\">recent report</a> on an Open Address Gazetteer, written for the UK Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). Existing address databases are often subject to licensing restrictions and cannot be made available as open data. Open data is information that is available for anyone to access, use and share.This new open data release will need to be sustainable, so part of the work will be to explore different revenue generating options, but the bulk dataset will always be available in full, for free, as open data</p>\n<p>There are existing address files in the UK but they tend to charge a fee, have a restrictive licence or are incomplete. An open address list will allow people to focus on using the data, rather than having to think about whether they can afford to do it, or are allowed to. The aim is to create a platform that will allow address publishers to enter new addresses whilst allowing consumers to either download in bulk, validate single addresses, or link to addresses through a persistent URL (Uniform Resource Locator, or “web address”). The Open Address list will contain only the addresses, it will not include individual resident’s names.</p>\n<p>ODI Technical Director Jeni Tennison says:  </p>\n<p>“Addresses are an essential part of the UK’s national information infrastructure. They are used in a huge number of datasets, from lists of schools to car parks. Open address information helps to improve data quality and add value to data. This grant will help to explore how modern, collaborative approaches to data management can reduce maintenance costs, improve quality and enhance the utility of address data. The ODI is delighted to announce the release of this funding based on the initial feasibility work that we carried out during the Discovery Phase of the Open Addresses project.”</p>\n<p>Further details will be announced soon about how the wider open data community can work collaboratively to build and deliver this new open data asset.</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/a-bigger-and-better-introducing-our-newest-members.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/a-bigger-and-better-introducing-our-newest-members","slug":"a-bigger-and-better-introducing-our-newest-members","title":"A bigger and better us - introducing our two newest members","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:52:31+00:00","created_at":"2013-10-24T17:56:15+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}}],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"Ahead of [our Summit](http://summit.theodi.org/) in London on 29 October, we're delighted to be announcing two new members; London-based [RateSetter](http://www.ratesetter.com), and Seattle's [Socrata](http://www.socrata.com).

They take our membership to 45, and are testimony to the international appeal and multi-sector influence that we are forging.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ratesetter\">RateSetter</h3>\n<p>We first collaborated with RateSetter earlier this year, when they helped us conduct <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/blog/peer-peer-lending-businesses-lead-way-opening-financial-data\">research</a> into the size and shape of the UK peer-to-peer lending market. Despite forming only three years ago, RateSetter is already a leading operator in that space, having matched over £120m in loans in the UK.</p>\n<p>It is not simply that they empower millions of ordinary people that draws us together; but rather the principles and tools that facilitate that. Critical of banks and regulators for their monopoly on financial information and control of risk, RateSetter collects and makes data available that helps individuals to lend and borrow to each other.</p>\n<p>By harnessing open data, RateSetter lets people take responsibility for their own financial risks and rewards; borrowers are suddenly able to say how much they need and are willing to pay, and lenders say how much they want in return of their investment. The result is a transparent, informed and connected financial community, quite unreflective of the traditional closed banking system.</p>\n<p>Rhydian Lewis, founder and CEO of RateSetter, said:</p>\n<p>\"We're excited to be working with the ODI to push the boundaries of what open data can achieve. We believe openness and transparency is fundamental in finance and as such sits at the heart of who we are as a company - from our live information feeds, to the way we conduct our credit checks. Data sharing can go beyond us as an individual company, it has the potential to benefit society as a whole, even to preventing another financial crisis. Looking down the list of other members, it’s exciting to be part of this wider data sharing movement, and we are proud to be playing our part\".</p>\n<h3 id=\"socrata\">Socrata</h3>\n<p>We're also delighted to be welcoming Socrata, a Seattle based cloud solutions company who help governments democratise their data. Their objective, much like our own, is to build a more transparent society, by giving citizens and developers access to information, and so bring facts into everyday decision making. Since launching in 2007, Socrata has worked with local governments in Chicago, San Francisco, New York City, Austin, Maryland, Illinois, and with public organisations such as the World Bank, Medicare, Data.gov and EnergyStar, to drive their transparency agendas by making their data more easily available.</p>\n<p>Perhaps their best known resources, GovStat helps policy makers to openly communicate the objectives and impact of government economic projects; while the Socrata Open Data API (SODA) allows developers to repurpose government data for use in web and mobile apps. Apps created with Socrata’s APIs include a real-time notice of parking violations for drivers in Chicago.</p>\n<p>Kevin Merritt, founder and CEO of Socrata, comments:</p>\n<p>\"Our membership of the ODI is synergistic with everything we are trying to achieve as a company. Governments of all shapes and sizes now recognise that data and information is not just a matter of compliance, but a powerful communication tool to empower citizens. We're looking forward to being an active member of the ODI as we work collaboratively with other members, and on an international scale, to continue to grow the impact of open data around the world.\"</p>\n<p>The ODI's Commercial Director, Stuart Coleman said:</p>\n<p>\"We're delighted to have attracted RateSetter and Socrata to the ODI, which takes our membership to 45 companies. These are two very different businesses that share a vision of supporting and using open data and open approaches. RateSetter provide more transparency and additional value to consumers. Socrata enable governments and citizens to more effectively interact by making it easier to publish, access and consume open data. Together they are excellent additions to the ODI membership programme.\"</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/member-blog-post-transition-towards-transparency.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/member-blog-post-transition-towards-transparency","slug":"member-blog-post-transition-towards-transparency","title":"Member blog post: The transition towards transparency","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:51:50+00:00","created_at":"2013-09-26T21:31:33+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/member-blog-creating-fruitful-partnerships-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/member-blog-creating-fruitful-partnerships-open-data","slug":"member-blog-creating-fruitful-partnerships-open-data","title":"Member blog: Creating fruitful partnerships with open data","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:51:48+00:00","created_at":"2013-09-10T09:52:18+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/africa-open-by-default-data-revolution.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/africa-open-by-default-data-revolution","slug":"africa-open-by-default-data-revolution","title":"Africa takes unified step towards becoming open by default","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:00:13+00:00","created_at":"2015-04-13T10:09:08+00:00","tag_ids":["news","data-revolution"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/data-revolution.json","web_url":null,"title":"data revolution","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=data-revolution","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/data-revolution","slug":"data-revolution"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"Last month, government ministers from across Africa made a monumental, unprecedented and unified commitment: together, they signed up to the principle of “open by default.” \r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"","url":"","content":"<p><em>Last month, government ministers from across Africa made a monumental, unprecedented and unified commitment: together, they <strong>signed up to the principle of “open by default.”</strong></em> </p>\n<p>African ministers have recognised the increasing importance of open data as part of the wider data revolution, and have agreed to adopt it by releasing official data. The next step is for governments and civil society groups to implement open data initiatives across Africa.</p>\n<p>The African Data Consensus was adopted by the <a href=\"http://www.uneca.org/cfm2015\" title=\"Conference of Ministers\">Conference of Ministers</a> which had been convened by the African Union and the UN’s Economic Commission for Africa. The ministers adopted the proposed document put forward by the High Level Conference on the Data Revolution. You can download a copy of the consensus <a href=\"http://linkis.com/url/redirect/http://www.uneca.org/sites/default/files/page_attachments/final_adc_-_english.docx\" title=\"here\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>As ODI Editor Anna and I <a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/data-revolution-addis-ababa-high-level-conference\" title=\"wrote\">wrote</a> in earlier blogs on the conference, 16 different \"data communities\" worked together to agree on a common, concise declaration about African data to guide the data in development agenda for the next 15 years. There were many different organisations in our \"open data community\", which pushed for the adoption of bold language on the release of data for anyone to access, use and share. </p>\n<p>The final document that was adopted strongly endorses openness, and includes the principle:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Official data belong to the people and should be open to all. They should be open by default.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>‘Data’ vs ‘statistics’</strong> </p>\n<p>There was some debate around whether or not the document should only guide official data and statistics. Several participants argued that the data revolution was about more than just official statistics, and pushed for the inclusion of data gathered from other sources. This resulted in the language: </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>African governments should acknowledge open data provided by credentialed data communities as acceptable sources of country statistical information. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, the African Data Consensus recognises the importance of opening up official statistics and data gathered from the plethora of other data producers in Africa. That both sources are considered valid is important, as both will have an vital role to play in combating challenges over the next 15 years.</p>\n<p>On the final day of the conference, the organisers declared that this was an important first step – finding agreement between 16 different communities represents real progress. But what comes next is most important. </p>\n<p>Various data communities agreed to continue to work together to develop a roadmap for the African Data Revolution, and keep emphasising the importance of data in driving progress throughout the continent. The consensus is useful to lay out a vision. However, there is a need to identify and commit to taking concrete steps toward achieving that vision. </p>\n<p><strong>From spreadsheets to sustainable development goals</strong></p>\n<p>It was clear to all attending the conference that the ultimate aim wasn’t merely to produce more data, or even more open data. </p>\n<p><strong>The ultimate goal is to use data, in its various forms, to achieve what has so far been so difficult: eradicate extreme poverty, and help achieve the other Sustainable Development Goals</strong>. </p>\n<p>These goals can only be achieved if ministers, civil servants, companies, academia and civil society organisations unite to open data, share knowledge, find innovative solutions and drive change. </p>\n<p><em>William Gerry is Junior Consultant at the ODI.

href=\"https://twitter.com/openstreetmap\">@openstreetmap</a></p>\n<p><strong>Hi Harry! How are you?</strong></p>\n<p>Very well, thank you!</p>\n<p><strong>What do you, or your organisation, do in a nutshell?</strong></p>\n<p>We use OpenStreetMap and operate within the OpenStreetMap community to create free, open-licensed, up-to-date maps, used by relief organisations responding to disasters and humanitarian crises.</p>\n<p><strong>What first got you excited about open data?</strong></p>\n<p>Collaborating on Wikipedia and the travel guide <a href=\"https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Main_Page\">WikiVoyage</a>. I got excited by wiki-style collaboration, and found my way to OpenStreetMap when it was forming here in the UK. This style of collaboration is very much enabled by open licensing, as people share in a spirit of co-creation and co-ownership.</p>\n<p><strong>What are your biggest data challenges?</strong></p>\n<p>With a very large number of contributors it's easy to achieve areas of good detail and quality within map data, but achieving consistent levels of detail and quality is a big challenge. This requires coordination, which is an area the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team works on with tools like <a href=\"http://tasks.hotosm.org/\">Tasking Manager</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>What kind of open data would you like to see more of?</strong></p>\n<p>In the humanitarian realm, an \"open by default\" approach for data would unlock massive improvements in aid delivery. For mapping, we'd love to get hold of more data from teams on the ground, for example, teams using <a href=\"http://fieldpapers.org/\">fieldpapers.org</a> (paper), <a href=\"http://mapillary.com/\">mapillary.com</a> (smartphone), or <a href=\"http://openaerialmap.org/\">OpenAerialMap.org</a> (drone imagery). </p>\n<p>OpenStreetMap is a constantly updating editable map, which is a powerful thing, but the open data aspect is what makes it truly revolutionary. </p>\n<p><em><strong>If you have ideas or experience in open data that you'd like to share, <a

Furthermore, openness is a core part of my practice of live coding, where all the code behind live music is on show. The ODI is a great environment to bring together my various activities around pattern in music, code and textiles, maybe opening up and transforming historical archives of pattern.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hannah Redler, Curator in Residence (ODI) said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Alex McLean has the gift of being able to produce work that is both genuinely avant-garde and highly accessible. His live coding performances and public workshops present the beauty of code and opens up its potential to broad audiences. We are terrifically excited to hear Alex’s sonic direction with open data, and delighted to welcome him as our first ever sound artist in residence in collaboration with Sound and Music.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Aimed at talented composers and creative artists, Embedded is Sound and Music’s bespoke professional development programme that gives composers the chance to work with a diverse range of innovative and established creative organisations, providing practical, hands-on experience as well as fostering long-term creative relationships. Partnering with the ODI for the first time, this residency will challenge the traditional ‘composer in residence’ model by creating a new context for sound artists in what is both a tech startup and a visually dominated space, reflecting the wealth of interdisciplinary collaboration in music today. </p>\n<p><strong>Kealy Cozens, Creative Project Leader (Sound and Music) said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As a proudly open and data-driven organisation it’s really exciting for Sound and Music to work with the ODI to place their first ever sound artist in residence. Alex is an incredibly talented artist at the forefront of live coding and this opportunity to work with world-class pioneers such as the Open Data Institute signals brilliant and bold movements forward in both the art and data worlds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gavin Starks, CEO (ODI), added:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As data becomes pervasive in all our lives, we need new ways to engage and interact with it as a material. Alex’s specific style reveals the inner workings of the machine, helping to dissolve barriers around digital literacy and creating a causal performance experience for the data-driven age.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See <a href=\"http://theodi.org/culture\">theodi.org/culture</a> for more information</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"WATCH - ODI Summit 2015: Data as culture panel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApReWTqRwcU&list=PL6DDzoHu1cx1Lwng4iDBnjoCVEmkGapXr&index=26"}],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/culture.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/culture","slug":"culture","title":"Data as Culture","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-08-19T11:02:10+00:00","created_at":"2012-11-25T22:02:06+00:00","tag_ids":["page","data-as-culture","culture","art","data-driven"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-at-big-bang-data-exhibition.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-at-big-bang-data-exhibition","slug":"odi-at-big-bang-data-exhibition","title":"ODI features in full force at Big Bang Data art exhibition","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-12-04T12:24:44+00:00","created_at":"2015-12-02T15:36:20+00:00","tag_ids":["news","data-as-culture","art"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/what-is-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/what-is-open-data","slug":"what-is-open-data","title":"What is open data?","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-01-05T15:22:05+00:00","created_at":"2014-10-30T15:43:18+00:00","tag_ids":["page","open-data","explained","what-is","introduction","closed-data","shared-data"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/about-us.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/about-us","slug":"about-us","title":"About the ODI","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-12-13T14:10:00+00:00","created_at":"2013-10-22T22:44:14+00:00","tag_ids":["page","open-data-institute"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/alison-smith-on-open-data-as-a-disabled-deaf-geek-ive-embraced-technology.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/alison-smith-on-open-data-as-a-disabled-deaf-geek-ive-embraced-technology","slug":"alison-smith-on-open-data-as-a-disabled-deaf-geek-ive-embraced-technology","title":"Alison Smith on open data: 'As a disabled deaf geek, I've embraced technology'","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:57:21+00:00","created_at":"2014-10-13T11:20:01+00:00","tag_ids":["news","summit"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/summit.json","web_url":null,"title":"Summit","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=summit","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/summit","slug":"summit"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>Ahead of her talk at the ODI Summit, we speak with disability arts specialist Alison Smith. </p>","excerpt":"In the wave of new technologies that are transforming the arts and culture sectors, are deaf and disabled people being left behind?\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"","url":"","content":"<p><em>In the wave of new technologies that are transforming the arts and culture sectors, are deaf and disabled people being left behind?</em></p>\n<p>Ahead of her talk at the <a href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/\" title=\"ODI Summit\">ODI Summit</a>, we speak with <strong>disability arts specialist Alison Smith</strong>. </p>\n<p>As well as managing numerous disability arts programmes, Alison has also been a performance poet.

As a deaf and disabled person and an arts lover you have seen for yourself the barriers of inaccessibility in the arts world. Has the situation improved in recent years?</strong></p>\n<p>The arts sector has embraced new technology to some extent, with more live streamed events, apps and social media. But I believe the situation for disabled and deaf audiences has worsened in recent years as organisations fail to treat digital access as a priority.</p>\n<p>The lack of understanding of digital accessibility across the cultural sector means that arts organisations just don’t get it. This will only change when funders introduce guidelines that ensure digital accessibility is part of future investment.</p>\n<p><strong>You set up Pesky People in 2008 as a response to a lack of digital access or inclusion online. Where have you made most headway since then, and what have been your biggest challenges?</strong></p>\n<p>One of our biggest achievements was to develop <a href=\"http://www.peskypeople.co.uk/\" title=\"Help 999\">Help 999</a>, an app to allow deaf people to contact the emergency services more quickly and easily, as part of the <a href=\"http://theodi.org/crime-and-justice-series\" title=\"ODI’s Crime and Justice challenge\">ODI’s Crime and Justice challenge series</a>. It has now been accepted on an accreditation scheme pilot for the emergency services. </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.peskypeople.co.uk/subtitles-now/\" title=\"#subtitlesnow\">#subtitlesnow</a> campaign that I led in June 2012 reached 50,000 people within days through Twitter and Facebook, and showed that deaf people could mobilise to raise important issues. We joined forces with a sister campaign called <a href=\"http://nad.org/issues/technology/captioning/captionthis-advocacy-toolkit\" title=\"#captionthis\">#captionthis</a> in the USA to challenge on-demand broadcasters to make their content accessible to deaf audiences.</p>\n<p>Securing funding has been a challenge. It’s hard to convince people of the potential and economic value of disabled people.</p>\n<p><strong>What will you be talking about at the ODI Summit?</strong></p>\n<p>I’ll be talking about how digital technology improves the lives of disabled people, but also my own journey as a disabled deaf geek and how I have embraced technology in developing Pesky People.</p>\n<p><strong>Which other sessions are you most looking forward to?</strong></p>\n<p>All of the sessions look fantastic. I’m particularly looking forward to the <a href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/sessions/open-data-in-humanitarian-crises-disaster-recovery-in-the-philippines/\" title=\"Open data in humanitarian crises: disaster recovery in the Philippines\">Open data in humanitarian crises: disaster recovery in the Philippines</a> talk with Kat Borlongan and the <a href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/sessions/web-science-technology-open-data-panel/\" title=\"panel discussion on the intersection of web science, technology &amp; open data\">panel discussion on the intersection of web science, technology &amp; open data</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>What direction do you see open data heading in over the next five years, and what most excites you about its future?</strong></p>\n<p>I believe we will see open data being used more to challenge and change the way different industries work. We can use it to hold people more accountable and advocate for change.</p>\n<p>I’m also excited about how we can use personal data to improve and inform our decisions. For example, I would love to see individuals using open data to challenge insurance companies. My travel insurance immediately doubles the moment I inform the insurance company I have asthma, despite having never been hospitalised with it. </p>\n<p><strong>As more councils, cities and countries open up their data, which sector do you think stands to gain the most, and why?</strong></p>\n<p>I’d like to see public social data being used to improve the lives of citizens. Particularly with sweeping austerity cuts that have impacted heavily on disabled people, people in poverty, the public sector and the NHS.</p>\n<p>The health industry stands to gain all-round, particularly in the ways medical data is collated and used. As individuals, we also have to be aware that such data can be used to our advantage and disadvantage.</p>\n<p>We are already sharing our personal data to such a degree we may find ourselves choosing what personal data we want to be offered as open or closed, but again that depends on how we interact with social media.</p>\n<p><em>Alison Smith will giving a Flash talk about digital technology and disability and the <a href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/\" title=\"ODI Summit conference\">ODI Summit conference</a> at BFI Southbank, London, on Saturday, 4 November.

It also asks members not yet part of the Open Government Partnership <a href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/\" title=\"(OGP)\">(OGP)</a> to consider the benefits of joining. </p>\n<p>This can be considered as testament to the rapid expansion of open data as a global movement. The action plan recognises that improving the transparency and availability of government data can encourage economic growth, rather than impede it. </p>\n<p>As the <a href=\"http://data.gov.ph/ODPH_APEC_150827_1416.pdf\">accompanying report</a> notes, \"the application of open data in both public and private sectors, coupled with innovation and technology, has been proven to unlock massive commercial and economic value.\" </p>\n<p>The action plan not only advocates open data on such practical grounds (that it unlocks economic value or optimises bureaucratic efficiency), but also by emphasising the importance of culture change. In a similar vein, it also calls for APEC members to develop “a vibrant ecosystem whereby governments, the private sector, civil society and individuals share and use open data.” It is clear that a concerted effort is being made to encourage governments to supply citizens with open data. </p>\n<p>A number of member states have included outreach activities in their open data initiatives to promote awareness among businesses and civil society organisations. The report also highlights the importance of peer-learning and support for open data practitioners. </p>\n<p>Challenges do remain for open data initiatives: technical ones, such as low internet connectivity, and cultural ones, such as a lack of high-level political support. The report notes the \"numerous dimensions involved in discussing the value, opportunities, and risks of data, especially risks of data,\" and for this reason identifies opening up data as a “low-hanging fruit.” </p>\n<p>It is true that opening up data is an indispensable first step towards fiscal transparency, but establishing openness as the norm for governance will involve more than just an adoption of technology and the release of data, it requires a change in the culture of government institutions. </p>\n<p>\"From the ODI's work <a href=\"http://theodi.org/open-data-leaders-network\">supporting open data leaders</a> in governments around the world, we have found that the biggest challenges tend to be cultural rather than technical,\" ODI International Development Researcher Fiona Smith says. “Open data requires a shift in the way government institutions work internally – from being 'guardians' of the data they produce, to becoming advocates of open by default. In this way, open data can be seen as a silo buster within government, as well as a tool for promoting transparency.”</p>\n<p>How far APEC members will bridge the gulf between words and substantial reform remains to be seen, however there are three important recognitions within the Cebu Action Plan that show the extent to which open data has become a global movement: that it is a necessity to governance, that it is conducive to economic growth, and that significant culture change is required for transparency to become a norm for governance.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Brendan Harvey is a <a href=\"https://theodi.org/team/brendan-harvey\">Services Programme Intern</a> at the ODI.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>If you have ideas or experience in open data that you'd like to share, <a href=\"mailto:production@theodi.org\" title=\"pitch us a blog\">pitch us a blog</a> or tweet us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/odihq\" title=\"@ODIHQ\">@ODIHQ</a>.</strong></em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-data-leaders-network.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/open-data-leaders-network","slug":"open-data-leaders-network","title":"Open Data Leaders Network","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-04-20T15:43:41+00:00","created_at":"2015-06-19T16:28:38+00:00","tag_ids":["page","leaders-network","services","international"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-data-leaders-in-government-finally-have-a-support-network-each-other.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/open-data-leaders-in-government-finally-have-a-support-network-each-other","slug":"open-data-leaders-in-government-finally-have-a-support-network-each-other","title":"Open data leaders in government finally have a support network – each other","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:02:56+00:00","created_at":"2015-08-11T10:45:34+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","open-data-leaders-network","open-government"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-data-in-government-how-to-bring-about-change.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/open-data-in-government-how-to-bring-about-change","slug":"open-data-in-government-how-to-bring-about-change","title":"Open data in government: how to bring about change","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:00:09+00:00","created_at":"2015-02-15T17:02:45+00:00","tag_ids":["page","change-management","open-data","government","open-government"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/bbc-signs-open-data-agreement-with-odi-deloitte-and-arup-join-membership-programme.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/bbc-signs-open-data-agreement-with-odi-deloitte-and-arup-join-membership-programme","slug":"bbc-signs-open-data-agreement-with-odi-deloitte-and-arup-join-membership-programme","title":"BBC signs open data agreement with ODI, plus Deloitte and Arup join membership programme","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:53:03+00:00","created_at":"2013-11-25T12:21:03+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>Three organisations with global reach have made commitments to catalyse open data programmes through collaborations with the Open Data Institute (ODI).

These are the BBC, Arup and Deloitte.</p>\n<p>ODI Commercial Director Stuart Coleman, explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Deloitte and Arup are leaders in their respective fields. These partnerships represent a great opportunity to exploit open data and drive new value for everyone across professional services, design and engineering communities. Our agreement with the BBC is a great step towards the provision of open access to one of our nation’s greatest cultural assets. We look forward to building upon these relationships.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"bbc\">BBC</h3>\n<p>The BBC and the ODI have today signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) at Broadcasting House. The MoU marks the BBC’s intention to make data available according to open data standards wherever possible. Another potential future project includes applying ODI <a href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/\" title=\"Open Data Certificates\">Open Data Certificates</a> to BBC open data sources.</p>\n<p>James Purnell, Director, Strategy and Digital, BBC, said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Since its formation just over a year ago the Open Data Institute has galvanised the debate around the economic and cultural value of open data, with the BBC taking an active role in the conversation and attending the recent ODI Summit. This MoU will give a shape to our discussions and help identify areas where we can work together to benefit the public, and I look forward to seeing the results.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The BBC today also signed MoU’s with the <a href=\"http://okfn.org/\">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/\">Mozilla Foundation</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Foundation</a> - further emphasising their support for open knowledge principles and standards.</p>\n<h3 id=\"arup\">Arup</h3>\n<p>Arup has joined the ODI membership programme as a ‘partner’. The firm has long been a champion of using data to help shape a better world. The group is specifically aiming to collaborate with the ODI and its partners on the role of open data in the built environment, not just for buildings and transport but also how we might use data to shape better health-care provision in cities. This is particularly important in an era of rapid urbanisation and the findings from the joint research will be published openly for others to reuse and share.</p>\n<p>ODI CEO Gavin Starks, said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Arup’s decision to join the ODI reflects data’s interaction with our physical world, and its influence on the practical and material decisions of how we build scalable, resilient cities to help meet the needs of society, our environment, and our economy. Arup produces and consumes huge amounts of data, and is in an excellent position to catalyse open innovation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Volker Buscher, Director and IT and Communications Systems Practice Leader, Arup, said: </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The world we live in is increasingly becoming interconnected and there is huge potential to use the data that we generate as a society to enhance our everyday lives. The opportunities are endless as through this information we can make transport more efficient, improve people’s health or reduce waste. But in order to achieve these benefits, we must all work together and that’s not just technologists or governments but people right across society. This ODI initiative provides a platform to be creative, innovative and open about the opportunities that lie ahead. And together, we can be smart about smart cities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"deloitte\">Deloitte</h3>\n<p>Business advisory firm Deloitte has also joined the ODI’s <a href=\"http://theodi.org/membership\" title=\"Membership Programme\">membership programme</a> as a ‘partner’ and aims to collaborate with the ODI on joint research projects looking into the use-cases for open data. Deloitte is incorporating open data into the analytics work it offers to organisations to provide them with richer insights into their markets and business operations. The firm is also using a wide array of open data in new research to investigate the forces of change on Britain’s banks and building societies.</p>\n<p>Costi Perricos, global and UK public sector leader for Deloitte Analytics, said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Open data fosters both economic and social growth. It underpins transparency and the Government’s engagement with citizens; it boosts public sector performance; and it is a rich source of new insights and innovative business models that will help to spur growth.</p>\n  <p>We look forward to building our relationship with the ODI under this new agreement. We share a common set of goals: to collaborate and build upon the already exciting research programmes that both organisations undertake, to draw upon Deloitte’s wide-ranging skills and knowledge to help open data start-ups and ultimately, to bring the insights and experience gained from this relationship to help our clients become insight driven organisations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><em>About the ODI’s Membership Programme</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Since launching in March 2013, the ODI's membership programme has <a href=\"http://directory.theodi.org/members\">signed up 50 organisations</a>, from SME’s to global corporates.

The occasion was supported by the ODI, \u0002the <a href=\"http://okfn.org/\">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/\">W3C</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/\">Open Government Partnership</a>.

We want to train the next generation of data entrepreneurs whose ambition will be to build new companies and new services using this data. We want to work with existing corporates to help them realise the value of open data. And to ensure our work has the widest national and international impact, we have to work with people who represent standards and international outreach.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"odiprogress\">ODI Progress</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/legacy/Gavin%2Din%2Dfull%2Dflow.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>ODI CEO, Gavin Starks shared some of the ODI's recent successes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Part of our remit at the ODI is to provide primary research and we’re delighted that we’ve started to sign up private members, like Virgin Media. We’re seeing a trend of large companies who are getting squeezed with their own budgets wanting to outsource their research and development to the community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gavin also talked about the importance of bringing on board start-up companies:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We’re also hearing from smaller companies, interested in us helping with finding funding. So far, we’ve helped to unlock a couple of million pounds worth of funding for start-ups. Just a few weeks ago we published our first open call for start-ups and we had 16 companies submit information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"commonsolutions\">Common Solutions</h2>\n<p>Phil Archer of W3C said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In this room are the people who invented link data, the people who work for politicians in the Open Government Partnership who are pushing the politicians to open data and make something magical happen. This workshop was designed to put in the same room people who have different approaches to this subject. We all believe in openness. But we do have different ideas as to how that can happen. This event is about working towards common solutions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"guestspeaker\">Guest Speaker</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/legacy/Tom%2DScott.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Web commentator, <a href=\"http://www.tomscott.com/\">Tom Scott</a>, was invited as guest speaker, and emphasised the importance of ensuring open data benefits everybody:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>8% of adults in Britain don’t own a mobile phone. That’s 4 million people. We do run the risk of leaving a lot of people behind – not just parents, but anyone who isn’t good with technology, can’t afford a fancier smart phone, or home broadband access. Open data and transparency are wonderful but we do need to make sure that we’re not just producing nice visualisations for text sites.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He brought the session to a close with predictions for the future:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Transparency is going to be the norm for everyone, at least in cities and the developed world.

noise figures, indicating possible effects on residents' health in surrounding neighbourhoods.</p>\n<p>As part of the startup’s ‘Breathe Heathrow’ project, funded and supported by the <a href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase\">ODI summer showcase</a>, OpenSensors deployed a network of air quality and noise sensors in local resident gardens. The project has assessed the impact of aircraft pollution in Heathrow’s neighbouring areas between September and October, 2015.</p>\n<p><strong>Sensor findings reveal</strong></p>\n<p>The average Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) reading in Sipson (1km from Heathrow airport), is 70µg/m3, with highs regularly exceeding 90µg/m3 – both higher than the 40µg/m3 <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/quality/standards.htm\">EU annual safe limit</a>.</p>\n<p>Beneath the flight path at Isleworth, high NO2 levels reached 75µg/m3 (9.65km from Heathrow airport).</p>\n<p>2.5km from the airport, noise levels regularly rose to 62–64dB, 5-7dB above the EU/UK 57dB ‘annoyance level threshold’. (1)</p>\n<p><strong>Health effects</strong></p>\n<p>Poor air quality causes approximately <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/271641490/King-s-College-London-report-on-mortality-burden-of-NO2-and-PM2-5-in-London\">9,500 deaths in London each year</a> and there are estimated to be <a href=\"http://www.euro.who.int/en/media-centre/sections/press-releases/2015/air-pollution-costs-european-economies-us$-1.6-trillion-a-year-in-diseases-and-deaths,-new-who-study-says\">600,000 premature deaths a year in Europe</a> caused by NO2 and lung-penetrable Particulate Matter (PM2.5).(2) Elevated levels of NO2 are linked to respiratory conditions(3) and high levels of noise pollution is also linked to sleep deprivation and heart disease.(4)</p>\n<p>Yodit Stanton, Co-founder at OpenSensors said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The sensor figures are particularly worrying as the data was captured during the windiest months of the year, when readings are diluted due to wind dispersion.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a result of strong volunteering support from local residents, 20 sensors were deployed spanning from West Drayton, to Windsor and Twickenham – making the Breathe Heathrow project the widest surrounding area of Heathrow ever to be monitored.(5)</p>\n<p>Yodit Stanton, Co-founder at OpenSensors said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“We couldn’t have achieved this project without help and support from the local community. Residents are very concerned about their local air quality and are frustrated there isn’t existing data collected outside of the immediate Heathrow airport location.</p>\n  <p>Putting data in the hands of locals will allow them to address their needs and make informed decisions on the effects current Heathrow operations and future developments may have on their lives.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When installing the sensors, the team gave each resident volunteer tutorials on how to use the real-time open data and interpret readings. The real-time open data, APIs and data visualisations are available at the <a href=\"https://www.opensensors.io/orgs/BreatheHeathrow\">Breathe Heathrow website</a> for anyone to access, use and share.</p>\n<p>Yodit Stanton, Co-founder at OpenSensors said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The debate surrounding Heathrow developments has been largely fuelled by subjectivity and an absence of hard-hitting data to back up claims. Breathe Heathrow enables data to do the talking, helping anyone with varied data skills to digest the findings, and use the data as neutral insight.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Scaling community-driven sensor projects and smart city developments</strong></p>\n<p>The project has demonstrated how city planners can scale smart city developments by involving the community. The project’s challenges have shown careful deployment of sensors with good connectivity, remote management and reliable peer-to-peer networks will aid developments requiring sensor monitoring in future.</p>\n<p>Building <a href=\"http://theodi.org/who-owns-our-data-infrastructure\">data infrastructure</a>, and the infrastructure for data collection, is important to help smart city developments thrive. Combining datasets published and maintained for maximum reuse, such as traffic, weather and flight data, will help to shed light on complex issues.</p>\n<p>Jeni Tennison, Deputy CEO and Technical Director at the ODI said: </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The Breathe Heathrow project demonstrates that our data infrastructure is not just built by governments or corporations, but can also be created by communities. Community-led open data projects can provide vital additional insight to complex problems from which everyone can benefit. OpenSensors has shown how convening a local network can generate open data; what we’d like to see next is this data being used to inform the debate around the development of Heathrow.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Continuing the Breathe Heathrow project</strong></p>\n<p>The work achieved during the ODI summer showcase has spurred three further Heathrow air quality projects with Greater London Authority, PhD students assessing the environmental impact of pollution and an expansion of deployed sensors for more robust analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>You can read the

title=\"Chris Hagerman\">Chris Hagerman</a>.</small></p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/budget-2016-documents\">budget</a> that had surprisingly little to say about data and the digital economy, we were relieved to finally see the announcement that the UK Government is providing £5m to explore building an open address <a href=\"https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/09/01/registers-authoritative-lists-you-can-trust/\">register</a>. This is an outcome we have been pushing for following our <a href=\"https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org\">Open Addresses</a> work. There is also positive news that that there is £10m funding for a hub of data science and a centre for excellence in economic measurement to support the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/\">Office of National Statistics</a> and allow it to act on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-review-of-uk-economic-statistics-terms-of-reference/independent-review-of-uk-economic-statistics-terms-of-reference\">the recommendations of the Bean Review</a>. Both addresses and statistics are vital parts of our <a href=\"http://theodi.org/data-infrastructure\">data infrastructure</a>.</p>\n<p>But we are concerned by the plan to move the Land Registry into the private sector. The government will need to be careful not to repeat the costly mistakes that it has made with address data in the past. </p>\n<p>Aside from these we note the lack of focus on the digital economy and entrepreneurship with little reference to data infrastructure, open data, <a href=\"http://theodi.org/open-banking-standard\">open banking</a> or digital innovation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"openaddresses\">Open Addresses</h3>\n<p>In 2014, with <a href=\"https://theodi.org/news/383k-government-grant-released-to-create-uk-open-address-list\">£383k of funding</a> <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/breakthrough-fund-and-release-of-data-fund\">from the Cabinet Office’s Release of Data Fund</a> and supported by the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/open-data-user-group\">Open Data User Group</a>, the Open Data Institute created a company, <a href=\"https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org\">Open Addresses</a> to explore how to build a truly open national address database. We identified how it could work and gained insight into <a href=\"https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/blog/2015/07/27/a-time-for-going-to-bed\">the difficult legal complexities, resulting in putting the company into hibernation</a>. We know that <a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/shades-of-grey-in-open-data\">the lessons learned</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/openaddressesuk\">code</a> we shared for others to use have helped the government make today’s decision. </p>\n<p>The decision is a testament to work from the whole data community who have long campaigned for UK addresses to be open data and who redoubled their efforts following the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Mail#Privatisation\">privatisation of the Royal Mail in 2013</a> and to the progress on <a href=\"https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/09/01/registers-authoritative-lists-you-can-trust/\">authoritative registers</a> being made by the Data Programme within Government Digital Service. We’re excited to see the challenge of building an open address register taken up by government.</p>\n<p>When address data is openly released it will unlock <a href=\"https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/mission/benefits\">an estimated £110m of value</a> for UK businesses, non-profits and government. Today’s announcement shows that the UK Government acknowledge that addresses are part of our core <a href=\"http://theodi.org/data-infrastructure\">data infrastructure</a> and vital to the operations of our society. Delivering this register will help the UK to keep pace with the other governments that have recognised the value of open address data, such as <a href=\"http://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/salle-de-presse/communiques-de-presse/open-datathe-first-french-collaborative-national-address-database-now-online\">France</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.data.gov.au/news-media/blog/geocoded-national-address-data-be-made-openly-available\">Australia</a>, the <a href=\"http://fedscoop.com/national-address-database\">USA</a> and <a href=\"http://www.epsiplatform.eu/content/value-danish-address-data\">Denmark</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"anoteofcautionwiththelandregistry\">A note of caution with the Land Registry</h3>\n<p>The budget also contained a note of caution for the data community with confirmation that the government will consult on options to move the operations of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry\">Land Registry</a> to the private sector. </p>\n<p>The information that the Land Registry holds about the land we live on – who owns it, what it can be used for, how it might be sold – is fundamental for the UK. It needs to be as accessible and usable as possible. It is key infrastructure for our economy, particularly given the government’s focus on housing. The ODI will be looking at the consultation and considering our response to it.</p>\n<p>When the UK Government privatised the Royal Mail it lost control of address data. As well as the years of lost benefits, the UK is now having to spend time and money rebuilding address data. It cannot repeat the same mistake with land data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"weneedtotakeeveryopportunitytostrengthendatainfrastructure\">We need to take every opportunity to strengthen data infrastructure</h3>\n<p>While we praise the commitment to opening up address data and improving national statistics, the budget had surprisingly little to say about data, open innovation and the digital economy and contains this significant risk to the UK’s land data.</p>\n<p>The budget’s aims were to strengthen the UK economy, support working people, back businesses and enterprises, create opportunities across the UK and revolutionise devolution. Data is <a href=\"http://theodi.org/data-infrastructure\">infrastructure</a> that cuts across and supports all of these themes. The cities, countries and even continents that build the best and most open data infrastructure will have an <a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/an-open-letter-to-the-chair-of-the-new-infrastructure-commission\">enormous advantage in the 21st century economy</a>.</p>\n<p>The UK needs to take every opportunity to strengthen its data infrastructure.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you have ideas or experience in open data that you'd like to share, <a href=\"mailto:production@theodi.org\" title=\"pitch us a blog\">pitch

How are you doing?</strong></p>\n<p>I am fine and elated that my organisation is nominated for the Open Data Awards. This truly makes us happy to be recognised beyond Nigeria. </p>\n<p><strong>What do you, or your organisation, do in a nutshell?</strong></p>\n<p>The role of my organisation, BudgIT, is to make data more simple and accessible for citizens, raising their ability to demand accountability from public officers. Layered on open data, we use creative representation to intersect civic engagement and institutional reform in Nigeria and Sierra Leone. </p>\n<p><strong>What first got you excited about open data?</strong></p>\n<p>We were interested in the potential to use data in open formats as a unit of communication and also the excitement and curiosity of citizens when they see our visualisations. We are glad to be making an impact, having reached over 270,000 citizens in Nigeria. </p>\n<p><strong>What are your biggest data challenges?</strong></p>\n<p>Most data in Nigeria is still limited to PDF, making it difficult for us to analyse. The biggest overhead in our organisation is the process of data clean-up, it is very challenging. Most of the time we also wish we had more comprehensive data to allow citizens to make better judgements. </p>\n<p><strong>What kind of open data would you like to see more of?</strong></p>\n<p>We would like to see more open data on actual spending in Nigeria, along with detailed budget data in Africa. This is crucial for our work as most governments cast a thick shield around spending data, which encourages corruption, especially in procurement. </p>\n<p><strong>How do you feel about being nominated for an open data award?</strong></p>\n<p>We are so glad to be nominated and also to be part of the final list. This gives a whole lot of excitement to the team. We are glad that respected people around the world see the impact of what we do, and find it right that we have been nominated for the Social Impact category. </p>\n<p><em>The <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/\">Open Data Awards</a> will be held on July 9 in partnership with Bloomberg at Bloomberg’s London offices on Finsbury Square.</em></p>\n<p><em>Explore all <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/nominations/\">nominees</a> and <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/2015-finalists/\">finalists</a> and follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ODIAwards\">#ODIAwards</a> for updates on the night.</em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"ODI Awards","url":"http://awards.theodi.org"}],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/announcing-the-2015-open-data-awards-finalists.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/announcing-the-2015-open-data-awards-finalists","slug":"announcing-the-2015-open-data-awards-finalists","title":"Announcing the 2015 Open Data Awards finalists","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:01:44+00:00","created_at":"2015-06-25T12:53:41+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","open-data-awards"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/prioritise-open-data-to-drive-global-development.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/guides/prioritise-open-data-to-drive-global-development","slug":"prioritise-open-data-to-drive-global-development","title":"How to prioritise open data to drive global development","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:00:04+00:00","created_at":"2015-04-01T12:44:22+00:00","tag_ids":["guide","guide","guide","guide","open-data","partnership-for-open-data","government","how-to"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/john-gibson-open-data-improve-regulated-markets.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/john-gibson-open-data-improve-regulated-markets","slug":"john-gibson-open-data-improve-regulated-markets","title":"John Gibson on open data: 'Let's make regulated markets work better'","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:02:27+00:00","created_at":"2015-07-06T15:19:32+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","open-data-awards","business","nesta"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/burkina-faso-launches-open-data-initiative-with-mentoring-from-the-odi-and-funding-from-the-world-bank.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/burkina-faso-launches-open-data-initiative-with-mentoring-from-the-odi-and-funding-from-the-world-bank","slug":"burkina-faso-launches-open-data-initiative-with-mentoring-from-the-odi-and-funding-from-the-world-bank","title":"Burkina Faso launches open data initiative with mentoring from the ODI and funding from the World Bank","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:55:49+00:00","created_at":"2014-06-05T08:56:42+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"Burkina Faso, a small country in the West of Africa ranked by the UN as the third poorest in the world, is today (5 June 2014) launching its new Burkina Open Data Initiative (BODI) in the nation’s capital Ouagadougou.

The platform is already home to over 50 government datasets that can be accessed and reused by anyone. Datasets on the platform include those from the Ministry of Health on the number of beds in public and private hospitals; the number of malaria deaths and vaccination coverage in Burkina Faso.  </p>\n<p>The goal is for local startup companies and entrepreneurs to use this open data to develop innovative new services which will benefit all Burkina citizens. </p>\n<p>Over the coming months, the Ministry of Development of the Digital Economy and Post will be raising awareness of the platform and open data amongst all Burkina ministries, with the aim of launching a full version of the platform in September with many more datasets.</p>\n<p>Burkina Faso is the first African francophone country to take this step into open data. The platform aims to boost the reputation of the country, encourage foreign investments and economic development, create new jobs in the ICT sector and increase participation from the private sector.  </p>\n<p>Furthermore a new open data community project called <strong>‘Our Schools, Our Data’ (Nos Ecoles, Nos Donnees)</strong> will be showcased at the launch event, where a 10-hour ‘visualisation sprint’ will take place. The project has received mentoring from the ODI as part of its support of the Burkina Open Data Initiative and involves gathering government teams, programmers, local tech communities and data-journalists around Burkina Faso’s education-related datasets. A new web app has been built for the project that displays data in a user-friendly way (see video below). </p>\n<iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/97404977?byline=0&portrait=0&color=ff9933\" width=\"100%\" height=\"391\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Participants at a workshop will create personalised maps and infographics, using the Our Schools Our Data app and tools like <a href=\"https://www.mapbox.com/\">Mapbox</a> and <a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org\">Open Street Map</a>. They will have access to data from schools in the test region of Komki Ipala, including student demographics, level of learning achievements, equipment rates, and the proximity to local services and utilities. For example a participant could bring together data on schools’ access to water and school performance - correlating the two and quickly creating an infographic to show the relationship. The sprint is not a competition, it is a way of showing that everybody (not just developers) can easily reuse open datasets and create online materials.</p>\n<p>Our Schools Our Data has been developed to improve citizens’ access to information about schools, as well as helping government better engage with technologists through face to face community building and empowering local communities by training them in surveying techniques and editing software. This in turn allows citizens to have a practical learning opportunity and a positive experience of working with open data. It is also hoped the project will generate interest in open data and spark a multi-stakeholder discussion of where open data should go next in Burkina Faso</p>\n<p>Like the open data platform, the goal is for Our Schools, Our Data to be deployed nationally over the coming months. </p>\n<p><strong>Liz Carolan, International Development Manager at the Open Data Institute said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With leadership from the very top, and a successful track record of ICT innovation, the Burkina government has shown characteristic ambition and determination to get this initiative off the ground. In doing so they have been able to get officials and citizens in Burkina Faso taking notice of open data. The Open Data Institute and the World Bank have endeavoured to be as light touch as possible - offering advice, bringing together the right people, freeing up funds. The result is an initiative which can potentially bring significant social, economic and environmental benefits to the people of Burkina Faso.     </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Mr. Alfred N. Sawadogo</strong>**, **<strong>General Director, National Agency for ICT Promotion (ANPTIC), Ministry of Development of the Digital Economy and Post, Burkina Faso, said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The sharing and reuse of public data creates a dynamic of innovation in services to citizens and business. Ensuring that every Burkinabe has access to information in order to improve the quality of his or her life - this is one of the major objectives of the initiative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Charles Ruelle, Technology Strategist at ODI Paris (FivebyFive), prior CTO of Etalab, the French Prime Minister's task force for open data, said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Burkina government has a strong background of collecting and producing data, especially in education, health and demography statistics. After having recently launched successful ICT projects, the Burkina government is now opening its information in the form of open data. These free raw materials will allow businesses, scientists, NGOs, communities, citizens and government to work together to find innovative ways to meet the daily challenges of the country.</p>\n</blockquote>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"Burkina Faso: data portal","url":"http://data.gov.bf/"}],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/call-for-nominations-open-data-awards-2016.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/call-for-nominations-open-data-awards-2016","slug":"call-for-nominations-open-data-awards-2016","title":"Call for nominations: Open Data Awards 2016","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-08-18T09:48:37+00:00","created_at":"2016-08-17T16:15:50+00:00","tag_ids":["news","open-data-awards"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/open-data-awards.json","web_url":null,"title":"Open Data Awards","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=open-data-awards","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/open-data-awards","slug":"open-data-awards"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>The ODI is pleased to announce that nominations for the 2016 Open Data Awards are now open.

This list will enable the public to see the wide range of activity in the community and the innovation that is happening in Canada around Open Data. The list will also assist organizations discovering other organizations that might provide partnering or collaboration opportunities The methodology and processes will follow the work of the <a href=\"http://thegovlab.org/\">GovLab</a> at NYU on their work on the <a href=\"http://www.opendata500.com/\">Open Data 500</a> in the United States.</p>\n<p><strong>Open Data Reference Model</strong></p>\n<p>In all sectors there is a need for standards, and the same applies to the Open Data community. CODI has initiated a project which seeks to evolve the Municipal Data Reference Model to an <a href=\"http://opendatainstitute.ca/projects/\">Open Data Reference Mode</a>l that can apply initially to public sector data and subsequently to include NGO data to assist in the ease and consistency of open data discovery and use. The project focuses on three areas: standardizing the categories/groups for data sets (possible use as tags); adding \"Also Known As\" names of data sets; and to initiate an inventory of existing standards and organizations involved in standards related to the open data community. Preliminary discussions have been held on potential collaboration from a local – global level. All are invited to contribute!</p>\n<p><strong>Open Data Request Framework</strong></p>\n<p>CODI is working with Cycle Toronto to develop a <a href=\"http://opendatainstitute.ca/projects/\">framework</a>that can be reused by any community member or group who wants open data and is new to asking for it and/or using it in their advocacy efforts. This will include a process to help identify: what kind of data is available to any given community, what kind of data will be helpful to advocacy objectives, who to ask for the data, how to ask for it, how to best use it in advocacy (e.g. data visualizations, applications), how to advocate for data sets that don’t yet exist and how to share the process with others in the community, as well as other elements to add to the framework that are uncovered through the case study.</p>\n<p><strong>Academic Open Data Research Repository</strong></p>\n<p>There is an increasing amount of research being undertaken on open data. A project is being initiated by CODI to facilitate the creation/expansion of <a href=\"http://opendatainstitute.ca/projects/\">Academic Open Data Research repository</a>. Community discussions have confirmed the value of having a single, searchable repository of not only existing academic papers/studies but also to introduce planned research projects. There has been a preliminary review of the possible use of the Open Research Network’s <a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/groups/opening_science/items/collectionKey/5A7JAT67\">Zotero Open Data Research repository</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Community Engagement</strong></p>\n<p>CODI maintains community engagement as a primary task.

Before joining the Met you focused on helping businesses to use the internet and technologies that would enhance their work. Were they generally quick to adapt and see the benefits, or were they slow on the uptake?</strong></p>\n<p>My experience is that this is less to do with sector than with size, age and culture of organisations. The Met Office is a world-leading scientific organisation working in the relatively young and fast-changing area of weather and climate. As we rely on very large-scale computing, we have to adapt very quickly to new technology. Equally, I have worked with smaller organisations in the private sector that think that IT or digital is ‘done’, when they release a new system or website. 'Digital transformation' is the term that we now all use to represent the accelerating need to change and not stand still. While that is challenging for all organisations, it has become the new norm and all successful businesses realise this.</p>\n<p><strong>As Chief Information Officer at the Met you focus partly on finding technologies to improve its forecasting services and make them more accessible and useful for the public. Which innovations have worked best for this so far?</strong></p>\n<p>A key innovation focus for us is about making data useful, as well as available. We work hard to understand how the public and business are trying to use our data and make sure that it is ‘packaged’, in technology that makes this as easy for them as possible. Weather data can be very complex, so for it to be useful we have to make it open and accessible. </p>\n<p><strong>What will you be talking about at the <a href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/\" title=\"ODI Summit\">ODI Summit</a>?</strong></p>\n<p>A single production run of a high resolution weather forecast for the UK generates some 380Gb of data. The Met Office runs a number of model configurations every day as well as longer-scale models which generate vast quantities of data. This data is made available to a global market. The Met Office is working hard to understand how we can ensure that access to the information contained within those data feeds is maintained, even with the ever increasing volumes, evaluating new technologies and methods of exchanging data, so that it is useable by as wide an audience as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Which other sessions are you most looking forward to, and why?</strong></p>\n<p>I am very much looking forward all of the sessions however given our mission to ‘save life and property, enhance wellbeing and generate economic growth’, those sessions looking at potential impacts will be especially interesting.</p>\n<p><strong>What direction do you see open data heading in over the next five years, and what most excites you about its future?</strong></p>\n<p>Open data is gaining momentum as the benefits are demonstrated all over the world. At the same time, data volumes are growing and it is getting harder for many to understand the provenance of data and how much they can rely on what they find. Sir Tim Berners-Lee and others have laid out a vision for the semantic web and standards to make this real. I am excited about the potential and benefits that will arise as this vision becomes real over the next five years.</p>\n<p><strong>As more councils, cities and countries open up their data, which sector do you think stands to gain the most, and why?</strong></p>\n<p>Ultimately it is the citizen that stands to gain the most, and that is all of us here in the UK. The Met Office mission is about enabling people to make informed decisions and we are more attuned than most to the benefits of this being done well, and the risks when it isn’t. Understanding our environment and how it changes, and using that to make informed decisions to behave and act differently gives us all enormous possibilities.</p>\n<p><strong>This year we’re holding the first ever <a href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/awards/\" title=\"Open Data Awards\">Open Data Awards</a>. Have you nominated anyone?</strong> </p>\n<p>We made a nomination around some of the <a href=\"http://productresearch.dundee.ac.uk/hacking-in-front-of-an-audience-met-office-at-the-va/\" title=\"work\">work</a> that the Met Office has done in partnership with the Victoria and Albert Museum about looking at data from a creative perspective. Different people understand information from data in different ways, and this is a great example of thinking about data differently.</p>\n<p>Charlie Ewen will be talking about open weather: how meteorology relies on open data concepts at the <a href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/\" title=\"ODI Summit conference\">ODI Summit conference</a> at BFI Southbank, London, on Saturday, 4 November.

Bike theft in the UK remains a persistent problem, the annual figures from <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/crime-stats/crime-statistics/period-ending-march-2014/stb-crime-stats.html#tab-Theft-Offences-–-Other-Theft-of-Property\" title=\"Crime in England and Wales, Year Ending March 2014\">Crime in England and Wales, Year Ending March 2014</a> point to 376,000 bikes being stolen (this figure covers those reported to the Police, and unreported). Check That Bike! wants to raise public awareness about bike theft and stop it being viewed as an unimportant low-value crime, when in fact many stolen bikes are worth thousands of pounds. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/4a/2d/544a2da6f362be08a9000016/bike.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"544a2da61f986a085f000004\"></p>\n<p>Check That Bike! was conceived and developed by entrepreneur John Moss. The service is offered for free as a way to persuade members of the public to investigate the history\nof a second-hand bike before they buy it.</p>\n<p>John says, “Check That Bike! is a way to check unique bike frame numbers against datasets of stolen bikes from Police and insurance records. It is much like the concept used for checking stolen motor vehicles, which have always received more attention because of their apparent higher value.”   </p>\n<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>\n<p>Check that Bike! works by accessing a number of databases containing stolen bike details. These databases include ad hoc police data; national registers including Stolen Bikes UK and\nBikesecure.co.uk; local registers including Stolen Bristol Bikes; manufacturers that run mini stolen bike registers for warranty purposes; insurers whose databases help identify stolen\nbikes when a claim is raised; and the Bing search engine.</p>\n<p>The majority of bikes manufactured in the United Kingdom have a unique serial number or asset tag printed on them, and using Check That Bike!’s search engine, people can enter\nthe serial number of the bike they are looking at buying to see if it has been\npreviously reported as stolen.</p>\n<p><strong>Open data</strong></p>\n<p>The wheels of Check that Bike! are in motion thanks to open data – the raw material for the service. The more stolen bike data John has access to, the more comprehensive the checks become. John says, “This is an open data project. The aim is to collect as much information as possible about unique numbers on bikes and offer a search engine. I'm operating on eight sources of data at the moment that have come from the police force and insurers, allowing\nme to look for hotspots on bike crime. However John highlights that the supply of open data isn’t always as forthcoming as he’d like: “I need a constant flow of data, which is currently coming in dribs and drabs.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the project, John has built strong working relationships with police forces across the country including Yorkshire, Leicestershire, Somerset and the West-Midlands – who give him regular data on stolen frame numbers. John also submits Freedom of Information requests for the data he needs – whilst this has resulted in the release of thousands of frame\nnumbers from stolen bikes, John wants to see far more of this information\nproactively released as open data.</p>\n<p>John is committed to actively challenging perceptions that bike theft is a ‘petty crime’ by\nunlocking the value of his concept. John reports that the service has\nidentified approximately 1097 stolen bikes (October 2014) with a total estimated value of £291,802.</p>\n<p>John’s commitment to openness and transparency doesn’t end with his use of open data.

Whether you’re new to a city and need help negotiating its transport system, or a commuter in your home town wanting the quickest (and driest) route home, Citymapper helps you get from A to B. It’ll even tell you when to get off the bus, and, for the health conscious, how many calories you’re burning. </p>\n<p>Citymapper works on iOS, Android and the web. It uses open data from Transport for London, OpenStreetMaps, Foursquare, Google, Apple, Cyclestreets, and other sources. Its weather updates are powered by Forecast.io. Along with London, the app now works in New York, Paris, Berlin, Washington DC, Madrid, Boston, Barcelona, San Francisco, Singapore, Mexico DF, Toronto… <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/theodi.org/forms/d/1wLVs2pwUwpa-sWXk9YMPsXrRH2pg4XaABh4Ir9RxaAo/viewform\">the list goes on</a>. </p>\n<p>I caught up with Citymapper’s General Manager Omid Ashtari at <a href=\"http://londontechnologyweek.co.uk/2015/04/bloomberg-technology-conference/\">Bloomberg’s Smarter Cities conference</a> on June 18, part of UK tech week. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/9c/d9/559cd959f362be652e000023/citymapper.png\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img pull-right\" id=\"559cd9591f986a2adc0000a1\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"omidashtari\">Omid Ashtari</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/thecoolgeek\">@thecoolgeek</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Citymapper\">@Citymapper</a></p>\n<p><strong>Hi Omid! You’ve been at Citymapper for around a year and a half now. How did you get there?</strong></p>\n<p>I worked at Google for seven years on a bunch of different things – maps and driverless car stuff – it was all quite exciting. I really got a passion for the location space and moved to a startup called <a href=\"https://foursquare.com/\">Foursquare</a>, which I then set up here in Europe.</p>\n<p>Since then I’ve got really excited about the nexus of location and mobile. In Citymapper I saw the opportunity to be a super innovative company that takes on a space thought to be conceded to the Googles and other big companies. It seemed like a really exciting opportunity. As the first business person I came in and really loved the team, the founder and the product so it was a no-brainer.</p>\n<p><strong>When did you start seeing open data as being central to the value of your work?</strong></p>\n<p>From the beginning, frankly. The exciting thing about what’s going on here is that London, and the UK as a whole, is really progressive in terms of embracing open data, which we’re quite happy about. Citymapper was created here because of the existence of open data. It’s the essential backbone of what we’re working on. </p>\n<p>We are seeing open data being embraced globally now. People are realising that it’s required for cities to put data out there. It’s slow progress in some places, which is frustrating, due to political issues – whether power issues or people just not getting it. But at least we’re seeing a trend that’s going in the right direction. </p>\n<p><strong>Which arguments do you think work best in promoting the benefits of opening data to groups like transport authorities?</strong></p>\n<p>Building apps isn’t easy, especially for consumers that are as demanding as those we face today. They want their apps to be integrated with their <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/uk/watch/?cid=wwa-uk-kwg-watch-com\">Apple watch</a> and their <a href=\"https://www.android.com/wear/\">android wear device</a>. They want the app to have all the bells and whistles and news technology that’s out there. The problem with agency-created apps is that usually they’re not built in-house, they’re built by third parties. You have a cycle of putting tenders out and having companies build the apps. But as soon as an app hits the market the specs that were defined a year ago are already out of date. The apps cannot keep up. </p>\n<p>I think we [developers] should do what we’re best at and they [governments] should do what they’re best at. [Transport authorities] deliver clean, on-time, reliable public transport and we'll take the data and build the best in class, cutting-edge app that has really cool things. Citymapper has context-aware direction data we give you for public transport, and ‘get off the bus’ alerts, and tube cycle routing, and all the other things we’ve build into the app that makes it so successful.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any other challenges you face in innovating?</strong></p>\n<p>The biggest challenges we face are the ones that come with being a company with global ambitions that wants to make the best app possible, locally. </p>\n<p>Also, the acquisition of data isn’t as embraced in all places as it should be. There are different levels of data: static data, which by now everyone more or less agrees should be there, even though some places don’t have it. Then there’s the realm of real-time data, which, for travel, allows people to see how their journeys might be affected by traffic. Even those who know their commute really well will want to know whether their bus is five or 10 minutes away, especially if it’s raining. </p>\n<p>Citymapper can give you that information if we have real-time data feeds from transport authorities. We want to see transport authorities embracing and understanding this. Ultimately our goals are the same: we want more people to use public transport and have a satisfactory experience when they’re doing so. </p>\n<p><strong>Where do you see open data going in the next 10 years?</strong></p>\n<p>Look, I think data is being created in many different silos at the moment. Open data is only really powerful when you can see trends across data sources and correlate them and do things. So I think interoperability of open data and data sources in different areas is going to be a big issue. Hopefully we’ll think about those things and have a way to exchange information. </p>\n<p><em><strong>If you have ideas or experience in open data that you'd like to share, <a href=\"mailto:production@theodi.org\" title=\"pitch us a blog\">pitch us a blog</a> or tweet us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/odihq\" title=\"@ODIHQ\">@ODIHQ</a></strong></em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/smart-cities.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/smart-cities","slug":"smart-cities","title":"A smart city is an open city","format":"article","updated_at":"2017-02-21T11:21:18+00:00","created_at":"2015-04-17T09:14:14+00:00","tag_ids":["page","smart-cities","sector","open","culture","cities","open-data","society"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/speaker-profile-bill-thompson.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/speaker-profile-bill-thompson","slug":"speaker-profile-bill-thompson","title":"Bill Thompson on open data: 'Nothing comes from nothing'","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:57:14+00:00","created_at":"2014-10-03T10:15:20+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/for-me-smart-cities-are-about-openness.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/for-me-smart-cities-are-about-openness","slug":"for-me-smart-cities-are-about-openness","title":"'For me, smart cities are about openness' ","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:00:49+00:00","created_at":"2015-05-14T07:55:57+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","5-minutes-with","interview","odi-individual-supporter","smart-cities"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/cma-announcement-signals-that-uk-can-lead-the-world-in-banking.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/cma-announcement-signals-that-uk-can-lead-the-world-in-banking","slug":"cma-announcement-signals-that-uk-can-lead-the-world-in-banking","title":"CMA announcement signals that UK can lead the world in banking","format":"article","updated_at":"2017-05-18T15:25:16+00:00","created_at":"2016-08-09T14:23:58+00:00","tag_ids":["news","open-banking","open-banking-standard","open-banking-development-group"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/open-banking.json","web_url":null,"title":"open banking","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=open-banking","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/open-banking","slug":"open-banking"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/open-banking-standard.json","web_url":null,"title":"open banking standard","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=open-banking-standard","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/open-banking-standard","slug":"open-banking-standard"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/open-banking-development-group.json","web_url":null,"title":"open banking development group","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=open-banking-development-group","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/open-banking-development-group","slug":"open-banking-development-group"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>The Open Data Institute welcomes the CMA’s final report, launched today: making banks work harder for you</p>","excerpt":"The Open Data Institute (ODI) welcomes the Competition and Markets Authority's final report, launched today: [making banks work harder for you](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/retail-banking-market-investigation-overview). \r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"CMA announcement signals that UK can lead the world in banking","url":"","content":"<p>The Open Data Institute (ODI) welcomes the Competition and Markets Authority's final report, launched today: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/retail-banking-market-investigation-overview\">making banks work harder for you</a>. </p>\n<p>Gavin Starks, CEO at the ODI said: </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The UK has the opportunity to lead the world in<a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/the-open-future-of-banking\"> open innovation in banking</a>, as shown in the CMA’s report.

It is calling on all individuals and organisations with an interest in the future of the banking sector to <a href=\"http://theodi.org/news/announcing-the-open-banking-development-group\">join the conversation.</a> </p>\n<p>The ‘remedies’ put forward in the report draw directly on the work of the Open Banking Working Group (OBWG), set up in 2015 by the Treasury and co-chaired by the ODI. In particular, the recommended API will use the <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/298568600/Introducing-the-Open-Banking-Standard\">Open Banking Standard framework</a>, developed by the OBWG. This will enable new customer-facing apps and services to be developed, helping consumers to share data securely and make better decisions about the banking products they use, and how they interact with banks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"benefitsforconsumersbanksandbusinesses\">Benefits for consumers, banks and businesses</h3>\n<p>When securely shared or published openly using open APIs, data can be used to build apps and services which help people quickly find what they need. For example, customers can look for a mortgage more easily, banks can find customers matched to a new product, and businesses can share data with their accountants. People will be able to choose services that are better, cheaper and simpler than those they were limited to before.</p>\n<p>Open banking also offers huge financial value for the banks and fintech companies as they become more efficient in their interactions and, in turn, are able to offer customers what they need, when they need it. </p>\n<p>Gavin Starks said: </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Building trust, increasing efficiency and open innovation in the banking sector can only be achieved when the banks, startups, consumer groups, and regulators work together. The<a href=\"http://theodi.org/news/announcing-the-open-banking-development-group\"> Open Banking Development Group (OBDG)</a> aims to do exactly that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Edward Twiddy, Chief Innovation Officer at <a href=\"https://www.atombank.co.uk/\">Atom Bank</a>, said: </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Open banking has its roots in international efforts across Europe to improve transparency and promote choice for consumers. It’s good to see the CMA come out in favour of retaining momentum and pace in the transformation of retail banking in this respect, and Atom will remain fully engaged with the government and the rest of the industry – including through the Open Banking Development Group - to press for these changes to happen as quickly as possible. However Atom is disappointed that the CMA recommends the change be lead by the incumbent high street banks when the future of banking competition lies elsewhere.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>For more information about the Open Banking Development Group, to become a patron, sponsor or member, please contact <a href=\"mailto:obdg@theodi.org\">obdg@theodi.org</a>.</em></strong></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Helen Desmond","slug":"helen-desmond","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/helen-desmond","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-banking-standard.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/open-banking-standard","slug":"open-banking-standard","title":"The Open Banking Standard","format":"article","updated_at":"2017-05-18T15:22:55+00:00","created_at":"2016-02-05T13:48:32+00:00","tag_ids":["page","open-banking","open-banking-working-group"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/the-open-future-of-banking.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/the-open-future-of-banking","slug":"the-open-future-of-banking","title":"The open future of banking","format":"article","updated_at":"2017-05-18T15:24:42+00:00","created_at":"2016-06-24T15:17:53+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","open-banking-standard","open-banking-working-group","open-banking","fintech"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Helen Desmond","slug":"helen-desmond","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/helen-desmond","tag_ids":[]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/code-europe-odi.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/code-europe-odi","slug":"code-europe-odi","title":"Code for Europe at the ODI","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:52:27+00:00","created_at":"2013-03-05T12:11:40+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}}],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"excerpt":"The ODI is hosting [Code for Europe ](http://codeforeurope.net)Fellows who are\u0002in London\u0002meeting open data entrepreneurs\u0002and sharing advice and ideas with one another.\u0002Code for Europe is working with city authorities across Europe to engage data technologists in\u0002exploring\u0002solutions to city challenges.\u0002","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"content":"<p>The ODI is hosting <a href=\"http://codeforeurope.net\">Code for Europe </a>Fellows who are\u0002in London\u0002meeting open data entrepreneurs\u0002and sharing advice and ideas with one another.\u0002Code for Europe is working with city authorities across Europe to engage data technologists in\u0002exploring\u0002solutions to city challenges.\u0002\nThe group is visiting London from 4th to 6th March and will be meeting organisations including\u0002<a href=\"http://mysociety.org\">mySociety</a>\u0002and <a href=\"http://wearemudlark.com/\">Mudlark</a> as well as ODI-based start-ups, <a href=\"http://www.locatable.com\">Locatable</a>, <a href=\"http://www.placr.co.uk\">Placr</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mastodonc.com\">Mastodon C</a>.\u0002Representatives from Code for Africa and Code for Latin America will\u0002also join a Code for Europe\u0002workshop at the ODI.\u0002\nSo far, six cities are involved in the initiative\u0002- \u0002Manchester, Helsinki, Barcelona, Rome, Amsterdam and Berlin – with \u0002ambitions to increase the numbers over the next year-to-18-months.</p>\n<p>In each city there is a team of technologists-in-residence, working on a\u0002digital service project.

The exhibition exploits the proliferation of data publicly available in society today, positioning people at the centre of data environments. Creating documentary-led artworks, Thomson &amp; Craighead’s unveil real-time orchestrations of time, space, weather, and corruption while challenging the viewer to question what assumptions we make in our daily lives.</p>\n<p>Hannah Redler, Curator in Residence at the ODI, said,</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Data Anthropologies’ is inspired by artists raising questions about how data is influencing the world. It challenges a common association with data that conjures thoughts of baffling images and inaccessible technology. We are inviting people to consider the role everyone plays in the emerging data landscapes we all navigate in our daily lives.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thomson &amp; Craighead’s materials include found YouTube footage, internet search terms and texts extracted from online sources. Works on display include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>‘<em><a href=\"http://www.thomson-craighead.net/docs/decnfh.html\">Decorative Newsfeeds</a></em>’ – live news headlines from around the world transformed into algorithmically drawn animated lines</li>\n<li>‘<em><a href=\"http://www.thomson-craighead.net/docs/mondays.html\">Six</a><a href=\"http://www.thomson-craighead.net/docs/mondays.html\"> Years of Mondays</a></em>’ – the artists’ interpretation of time-lapsed weather recordings, originally published online by a Scottish man who records the weather outside his window every day from 6AM - 6PM </li>\n<li>‘<em><a href=\"http://www.thomson-craighead.net/docs/flippedclock.html\">Flipped Clock</a></em>’ – a fully functioning digital clock that challenges how we see time by rotating each displayed digit by 180°</li>\n<li><em>‘London Wall EC2’</em> – a collection of woodblock-style typographic tweets culled from recent messages sent from the Shoreditch area surrounding the ODI.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thomson &amp; Craighead, ODI Artists in Residence, said,</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Using a mixture of live information feeds, generative processes and more traditional techniques, we’re offering up a series of narrative glimpses of the world as it is mediated by online communications. Ultimately, we’re holding up a mirror to ourselves and making documentary artworks as participant observers. It has been an exciting challenge to exhibit away from publishing works online and exhibiting in galleries and museums. We hope our collection provokes interest during its time at the ODI.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Using art to catalyse an open culture</strong></p>\n<p>The Data as Culture 3 season continues the ODI’s <a href=\"http://theodi.org/culture\">commitment</a> to unearth new understandings of open data and engage with wider audiences. Established in 2012, the art programme has  achieved international reach, exhibited 14 artists, commissioned 6 pieces and will expand again this year. The programme supports the ODI’s ambition to catalyse positive social, economical and environmental impact with open data.</p>\n<p>Julie Freeman, Art Associate, leading the Data as Culture programme said,</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"We need new perspectives on open data. What we find upon opening things up will sometimes be messy. Our chosen Data as Culture 3 artists are adept at looking beyond sanitised content and explore what's beneath and beyond. I am very excited about the ideas they will generate, and the provocations they will make.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thomson &amp; Craighead’s artists’ residency at the ODI begins in March 2015 and ends in June 2015. From July 2015 until December 2015 the ODI is welcoming photographic artist Natasha Caruana as the next Artist in Residence. The Artists in Residence will be creating new works responding to open data, joining Julie Freeman’s ‘<a href=\"http://weneedus.org/\">We Need Us</a>’, in the ongoing programme.</p>\n<p><strong>Viewing Data as Culture 3</strong></p>\n<p>Following the official private view launch event on 24 March 2015, the exhibition can be viewed by prior arrangement Monday to Friday during office hours (excluding bank holidays) from 30 March 2015.

Using data as a material increases awareness of what data is, how it can be used creatively, how it can inspire, encourage play and lateral thinking, and help people share stories and experiences.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Works include James Bridle’s <em>Watching the Watchers</em>, a series of prints showing military drone bases, exposing the all seeing eyes used by armies worldwide with the help of Google Earth. A banner by Sam Meech visualises working hours as knitting patterns and YoHa’s fun and cynical <em>Invisible Airs</em> pneumatic contraptions respond to spending data from Bristol City Council, causing a spud gun to fire, a bicycle seat to rise up and down and a knife to stab a book - their financial reports. thickear collective will process personal data in their <em>Pink Sheet Method</em> performance taking place across three cities, while Paolo Cirio’s self-reflecting exhibition catalogue exposes visitor’s digital fingerprints as they look at the work.</p>\n<p>Gavin Starks, ODI CEO, said, </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The Data as Culture programme challenges us to question the role of data in society. For example, the tools of surveillance are available to many - as illustrated in James Bridle work showing “secret” drones visible using public satellite maps. The comedic open data book stabber reflects how truly tedious and mundane data gathering and processing is. We want to ensure conversations about open data expand beyond specialist communities and through to the general public.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Shiri Shalmy, commissioned curator, said, </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The exhibition presents a wide range of creative approaches to the use of data, intentionally moving away from screen-based representations of information and instead experimenting with the possibilities of manifesting data in physical form. While in some cases visitors are asked to simply join the dots, in others they must respond to the artist’s call: give us your data!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The exhibition will be open to members of the public during office hours, Monday to Friday. Visitors are advised to ring ahead if possible on 020 3598 9395, or email <a href=\"mailto:info@theodi.org\">info@theodi.org</a>.</p>\n<p>To broaden the reach of the exhibition, the ODI has partnered with <a href=\"http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/\">Lighthouse</a>, a digital culture agency and gallery in Brighton, and <a href=\"http://futureeverything.org/\">FutureEverything</a>, based in Manchester, who are critically engaged in technology, and run one of the longest standing media arts festivals in the world.

They will also help define the challenges along with the Data Pitch team and a range of industry experts spanning from agriculture to health. Startups will be encouraged to use this data to address the challenges by developing innovative products and services. </p>\n<p>Startups and SMEs will be able to apply for a place on Data Pitch from 1 July 2017. </p>\n<p>Successful startups will be selected in October and November 2017, and the first cohort will join in December 2017. Each startup will be on the programme for six months. </p>\n<p>The ambition is to create an innovation ecosystem for Europe, where larger organisations work closely with agile startups to innovate and learn from each other, using data as an enabler to solve problems. </p>\n<p>Elena Simperl, Professor at University of Southampton and Data Pitch project Director said: </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Data Pitch will create a European ecosystem for data-driven innovation. In the digital age, every organisation – public or private, big or small – generates and owns substantial data assets. Not all of them have the opportunity to use this data effectively. With Data Pitch, we take an established open innovation model and apply it at European scale – we pair some of the most creative entrepreneurial minds in 28 countries and help them to solve data challenges that matter – for the economy, for the environment, for science, and for society as a whole.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jeni Tennison, CEO at the ODI said: </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Startups have the skills, agility and energy to create novel and innovative solutions using data. Corporates need to understand the benefits of publishing and sharing data to take advantage of this innovation and realise the efficiencies, product opportunities and increased productivity that effective use of data can bring. Data Pitch will allow both corporates and startups to experiment with ways of encouraging open innovation using data in a safe environment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Data Pitch will begin by running online and offline ‘datathons’ in Spring 2017, around themes including smart cities, health and wellbeing, and food and agriculture. Ideas for the datathons will be crowdsourced and put forward by data providers, bringing together startups, data scientists and experts to work on a case during a hackathon.  </p>\n<p><em><strong>For more information go to: <a href=\"https://datapitch.eu/\">www.datapitch.eu</a></strong></em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"TechCrunch covers Data Pitch","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/09/europe-funds-another-data-accelerator-to-get-startups-tackling-societal-problems/"}],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/harness-the-power-of-startups.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/harness-the-power-of-startups","slug":"harness-the-power-of-startups","title":"Harness the power of startups","format":"article","updated_at":"2017-04-05T13:48:55+00:00","created_at":"2017-03-31T13:32:41+00:00","tag_ids":["page","startups","open-innovation","incubator","startup-accelerator"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/democracy-club-on-open-data-vote-elections.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/democracy-club-on-open-data-vote-elections","slug":"democracy-club-on-open-data-vote-elections","title":"Democracy Club on open data: ‘Telling people where they can vote shouldn’t be this hard'","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:02:05+00:00","created_at":"2015-07-08T10:36:39+00:00","tag_ids":["news","open-data-awards","uk-government","general-election","democracy"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/open-data-awards.json","web_url":null,"title":"Open Data Awards","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=open-data-awards","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/open-data-awards","slug":"open-data-awards"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/uk-government.json","web_url":null,"title":"UK government","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=uk-government","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/uk-government","slug":"uk-government"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/general-election.json","web_url":null,"title":"General Election","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=general-election","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/general-election","slug":"general-election"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/democracy.json","web_url":null,"title":"democracy","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=democracy","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/democracy","slug":"democracy"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>Democracy Club on open data: ‘Telling people where they can vote shouldn’t be this hard'</p>","excerpt":"With the 2015 [Open Data Awards](http://awards.theodi.org/) just around the corner, we catch up with Sym Roe, Coordinator at [Democracy Club](https://democracyclub.org.uk/), a finalist for the Open Data Social Impact Award.\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"Democracy Club on open data: ‘Telling people where they can vote shouldn’t be this hard'","url":"","content":"<p><em>With the 2015 <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/\">Open Data Awards</a> just around the corner, we catch up with Sym Roe, Coordinator at <a href=\"https://democracyclub.org.uk/\">Democracy Club</a>, a finalist for the Open Data Social Impact Award.</em></p>\n<p><em>The <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/\">Open Data Awards</a> celebrate innovation and excellence in open data across the world.

How are you doing?</strong></p>\n<p>Hello! I’m well thank you. I’m writing this on a train on the way back from talking to Local Government Digital about how we can work together in future. It’s exciting to see such interest in improving elections, even when we’re months away from the next set.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you, or your organisation, do in a nutshell?</strong></p>\n<p>We change the world by building live proofs of concept to inspire governments to make democracy better. In 2015 we build an open list of people who were standing for the UK General Election, tried to build a polling station locator tool, collected election leaflets, lists of husting, CVs of candidates, and lots more.</p>\n<p><strong>What first got you excited about open data?</strong></p>\n<p>Trick question: open data is not exciting on it’s own. It’s the applications that make it exciting. The first tool that I build that used open data was the <a href=\"http://farmsubsidy.openspending.org/\">FarmSubsidy.org</a> website – I enjoyed seeing how the common agricultural policy could be informed by a tool that allowed journalists and the public to find out where money was being spent.</p>\n<p><strong>What are your biggest data challenges?</strong></p>\n<p>We’re trying to build tools and services that rely on data that simply doesn’t exist in the public domain. The full list of candidates isn’t even collected anywhere, so we have to compile one from news stories and party websites. The location of polling stations is known, but we only got about 5% of the data from a Freedom of Information request to all councils. Telling people where they can vote shouldn’t be this hard!</p>\n<p><strong>What kind of open data would you like to see more of?</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s start with user needs and work backwards, using open data as a tool alongside the others that are needed to improve public services (like better communication between silos). The thing I’m thinking about most at the moment is how to join councils up a bit more, and make them easier to interact with at a national level – that is, how to get a list of all the open consultations within 10 miles of you, regardless of council boundaries.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you feel about being nominated for an open data award?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s nice to be recognised after a huge amount of effort from all the team. We’ve had no direct funding for the 2015 projects we ran, but we feel like we provided an important service to the public, and made the election better for everyone in some small way. Nomination has given us the motivation to continue on into 2016.</p>\n<p><em>The <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/\">Open Data Awards</a> will be held on July 9 in partnership with Bloomberg at

The archive, which will be updated periodically, provides data on the quality of rivers, lakes and estuaries, and includes data on 58 million measurements on nearly 4 million samples carried out by the agency between 2000 and 2015. </p>\n<p>This most recent release means EA has reached its <a href=\"https://defradigital.blog.gov.uk/2015/06/25/opendefra/\">#opendefra</a> target to release 1,500 datasets, towards the 8,000 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/environment-secretary-unveils-vision-for-open-data-to-transform-food-and-farming\">set by Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Liz Truss</a> for Defra in June 2015. It also follows on from six years of successful publication of <a href=\"http://environment.data.gov.uk/bwq/profiles/\">bathing water quality data</a> by EA, with the help of ODI Member, <a href=\"http://www.epimorphics.com/\">Epimorphics</a>. </p>\n<p>With support from the <a href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase\">ODI Showcase</a>, Epimorphics carried out <a href=\"http://www.epimorphics.com/reports/how-clean-is-the-water/\">research</a> into the impacts of publishing this data openly. In its report, ‘<a href=\"http://www.epimorphics.com/reports/how-clean-is-the-water/\">How clean is the water?</a>,’ Epimorphics explores the benefits of making water quality data open, not only for EA but also for data users, local authorities and campaign organisations. For example, <a href=\"http://www.sas.org.uk/\">Surfers Against Sewage</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.mcsuk.org/\">Marine Conservation Society</a> use the data for scientific analysis and trend-monitoring, to organise and campaign for remedial action and to hold water companies and the environmental agencies to account.</p>\n<p>Though the benefits and beneficiaries of EA’s latest release may differ, the examples of the uses and benefits of open bathing water quality data that are set out in ‘How clean is the water?’ illustrate the value of publishing environmental data openly.</p>\n<p><strong>EA going open: its transition and benefits</strong></p>\n<p>For EA, the release of this data is part of its own commitment to release all of its charged-for datasets as open data by April 2018. We developed an <a href=\"http://theodi.org/ea-going-open-summary\">in-depth case study</a> on EA last year. We found that as well as facilitating innovative new products, cost savings and efficiencies for businesses and government, making its data open has benefited EA itself. The process and impact of ‘going open’ helped achieve its core objective, increase efficiency and engage with external organisations much better.</p>\n<p>Based on EA’s experience, the case study drew out some useful <a href=\"http://theodi.org/ea-going-open-lessons-learnt\">lessons for other organisations</a> considering open their data. In particular: to consider licensing and terms from the outset, to publish data in accessible formats, to create user feedback loops to evaluate data’s impacts and to promote data and engage users.</p>\n<p><strong>Beyond open: EA data use and benefits</strong></p>\n<p>With every release, EA comes closer to realising its ambition to become an open-by-default organisation and the widespread uses and benefits of its data are emerging.</p>\n<p>\"We have released some really interesting data and seen it used in surprising ways,\" says Miranda Kavanagh, Director of Evidence, Environment Agency, in a <a href=\"https://defradigital.blog.gov.uk/2016/04/21/environment-agency-going-above-and-beyond/\">blog</a> published today. </p>\n<p>\"In September, we made <a href=\"https://environmentagency.blog.gov.uk/2015/09/18/laser-surveys-light-up-open-data/\">LIDAR</a> available for free. Archaeologists have used this data to find Roman roads; it’s been used to help the<a href=\"http://surreydigitalservices.github.io/blog/2016/03/QGIS-Rooftop-Aspect-Analysis\"> optimisation of rooftop solar cell installation</a>; and gamers have used it to create realistic 3D worlds in the computer game Minecraft. In January we released information about <a href=\"https://defradigital.blog.gov.uk/2016/01/20/flood-defences-dataset-made-open-data/\">flood defences</a> and we have recently released additional <a href=\"https://defradigital.blog.gov.uk/2016/03/31/historical-flood-data-goes-open/\">flood data</a>. Previously we had seen a number of innovative uses of our flood data, such as a free mobile app from <a href=\"http://www.redcross.org.uk/What-we-do/Emergency-response/Emergency-app\">The Red Cross</a> which combines our flood warnings data and Met Office weather warnings to issue real-time alerts about severe weather.</p>\n<p>This work at EA, as part of Defra, helps to build a more collaborative and responsive environmental <a href=\"http://theodi.org/what-is-data-infrastructure\">data infrastructure</a>. Opening up its diversity of environmental data – spanning water quality, height and elevation, marine and coastal ecosystems and flooding and much more – helps communities, businesses and different parts of government work better together to improve and discover new services, target interventions and manage resilience.  </p>\n<p><em><strong>Anna Scott is a <a href=\"https://theodi.org/team/anna-scott\">Writer / Editor</a> and Jamie Fawcett is <a href=\"http://theodi.org/team/jamie-fawcett\">Research Assistant</a> at the ODI.

The analysis, using open spending data, also shows wide variations in carbon efficiency - over the same period, £4.6bn was spent with companies who have low energy and carbon efficiency (when compared to better-performing peers). AMEE is an <a href=\"https://directory.theodi.org/members/GY5132UY\">ODI supporter</a> and Spend Network is a member of the <a href=\"http://theodi.org/start-ups\">ODI startup programme</a>. </p>\n<p>The study is the first of its kind and uses each government department’s open data to identify spending with companies. This amounts to £44 billion of expenditure in 12 months. This data has been supplemented by data about supply chains and carbon efficiency for individual companies sourced from AMEE. Using this information, the researchers estimate that government procurement could influence up to 97 million tonnes of carbon emissions from all supplier activities, representing 15% of total UK emissions, with 4.7 million tonnes directly related to government activities. </p>\n<p>The team behind the research conclude that a concerted effort by government, encouraging all suppliers to reduce their total carbon footprints, would provide a large contribution toward reducing total UK emissions and achieving the UK’s carbon budget. </p>\n<p><strong>Best and worst performers</strong></p>\n<p>Of 17 departments assessed, the researchers found that the Department for Education comes out as the least energy-efficient with a ratio of 193 grams of carbon emissions per £1 spent. This is compared to the best performer, HM Treasury, with just over 15 grams for every £1 spent.</p>\n<p>The study found the Home Office to have the most financially risky supply chains with 25% of spend going to suppliers that have high or very high risk. In contrast, The Ministry of Justice was found to have the least at-risk spend profile with 0.2% of spend going to high or very high risk suppliers.</p>\n<p><strong>Social value</strong></p>\n<p>It’s hoped that the research will provide a useful tool for policy makers and citizens interested in procurement, supply chains and sustainability. Specifically, the team believe it will help to address obligations under the Social Value Act 2013, which requires public organisations to incorporate sustainability into procurement decisions. </p>\n<p><strong>Tyler Christie, CEO of AMEE said:</strong></p>\n<p>\"These findings indicate the immense opportunity for government to cut costs, reduce risk, and achieve its carbon budget goals through improved data-driven supply chain policies and management. This is the first analysis of its kind and provides specific, public data and guidance to implement the Social Value Act in order to drive carbon reductions and mitigate climate change.”</p>\n<p><strong>Ian Makgill, MD of Spend Network said:</strong></p>\n<p>\"This is a great example of the potential impact of publishing government spending data as open data. Now, for the first time ever, the public can see the environmental impact of the buying decisions made by government. AMEE and Spend Network will continue to work together to allow the public to monitor the progress that government makes with their supply chain.\"</p>\n<p><strong>The ODI’s Technical Director, Jeni Tennison said:</strong></p>\n<p>“If government’s procurement decisions are to factor in environmental sustainability, they need to be able to access data about their prospective suppliers. This study demonstrates how open data about supply chains and environmental impact could help inform those decisions, and lead to greater accountability, driving towards a positive environmental impact. </p>\n<p>“Departments and companies that release open financial, supply chain and environmental data should be applauded for their transparency, as should organisations like Spend Network and AMEE who clean, aggregate and extract value from this data, particularly when they then publish it as open data. There is much more to do here, in terms of data being available and being exploited, to help inform the decisions that can reduce the government’s environmental impact.”</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[{"name":"Spend Network","slug":"spend-network","url_helper":"http://theodi.org/start-ups/spend-network"}],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[{"name":"Spend Network","slug":"spend-network","url_helper":"http://theodi.org/start-ups/spend-network"}],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/european-data-portal-bringing-open-datas-economic-benefits-to-public-bodies.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/european-data-portal-bringing-open-datas-economic-benefits-to-public-bodies","slug":"european-data-portal-bringing-open-datas-economic-benefits-to-public-bodies","title":"European Data Portal: bringing open data’s economic benefits to public bodies","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-02-18T10:46:25+00:00","created_at":"2016-02-18T10:29:43+00:00","tag_ids":["news","european-data-portal"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/european-data-portal.json","web_url":null,"title":"European Data Portal","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=european-data-portal","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/european-data-portal","slug":"european-data-portal"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>In line with the launch of its official site, the European Data Portal is gathering stories and economic insights to bring to public bodies who could benefit more from open data</p>","excerpt":"In line with the launch of its [official site](http://www.europeandataportal.eu/), the EDP is gathering stories and economic insights to bring to public bodies who could benefit more from open data\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"European Data Portal: bringing open data’s economic benefits to public bodies","url":"","content":"<p><em>In line with the launch of its <a href=\"http://www.europeandataportal.eu/\">official site</a>, the EDP is gathering stories and economic insights to bring to public bodies who could benefit more from open data</em></p>\n<p>The official first version of the <a href=\"http://www.europeandataportal.eu/\">European Data Portal</a> (EDP) is launched today, with a mission to improve accessibility and increase the value of open data.</p>\n<p>The EDP harvests the metadata of public sector information available on public data portals across European countries.

“Håkan Dahlström\").</small></p>\n<p>Last week, politicians, finance industry groups and tech professionals gathered for a series of events, talks and online commentary in celebration of FinTech week 2016. </p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/fintech-week-2016-celebrating-britains-status-as-a-leading-fintech-hub\">speech</a> given at the Association of British Insurers, Economic Secretary Harriett Baldwin hailed the week as a prime opportunity to celebrate the UK’s status as a leading global FinTech hub, and work out how to become and remain ‘the’ global leader in the area. </p>\n<p>In her speech, Baldwin mentioned exciting developments in the insurance tech industry that are largely made possible by a growing commitment within the sector to using and producing <a href=\"http://theodi.org/what-is-open-data\">open data</a>. Emphasising how the government's open data initiative was helping to transform how underwriters price risk, Baldwin gave the example of how motor insurance products were being designed using <a href=\"https://data.gov.uk/data/search?q=dvla\">publicly available DVLA data</a>.</p>\n<p>Another opportunity raised was around blockchain technology and its revolutionary potential for the insurance industry in helping to reduce fraud. This comes after the Government Office for Science released a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/distributed-ledger-technology-blackett-review\">Blackett Review on distributed ledger technology</a>, which called for government leadership and investment in how it could be used to enhance government services. </p>\n<p>As the ODI and the Digital Catapult highlighted in their <a href=\"http://theodi.org/news/blockchains-odi-and-digital-catapult-respond-to-blackett-review-on-distributed-ledger-technology\">joint response</a> to the Blackett Review, these are important focal points for government in helping to build and maintain a robust <a href=\"http://theodi.org/data-infrastructure\">data infrastructure</a> and ensure efficiency in the ways data can be accessed and used across sectors. But alongside enthusiasm for open approaches and new technologies, standards must be set to guide how they can be designed and used to best effect. These standards are best developed by solving common challenges for a sector. <a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/comment-blockchains-technology-useful-not-for-everything\">Blockchain technology will be useful, but not for everything.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Setting an Open Banking Standard</strong></p>\n<p>Set up at the request of HM Treasury in September 2015, the <a href=\"http://theodi.org/news/open-banking-working-group-terms-of-reference\">Open Banking Working Group</a> convened a wide range of people from across the banking sector and recently set out an <a href=\"http://theodi.org/open-banking-standard\">Open Banking Standard</a> framework.</p>\n<p>Making better use of data will improve people’s banking experience. When securely shared or published openly using open APIs, the data can be used to build useful applications and resources to help people find what they need. Banks can find customers matched to a new product, businesses can share data with their accountants and customers can find services that suit their needs and save money. </p>\n<p>For example, switching overdraft facilities could save people an average of £140 a year, according to a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/470032/Banking_summary_of_PFs.pdf\">market investigation</a> by the Competition and Markets Authority. If customers could securely share their transaction data with third parties through an open API, potential credit providers could use it to better target their loans.</p>\n<p>In helping to create services that make life better for customers the Open Banking Standard will improve efficiency, stimulate innovation and bolster the UK’s already thriving FinTech market. A market that, as Baldwin emphasised in her speech, generated over £6.5bn last year just in the UK. We expect that the global FinTech revenues received by UK companies will be significantly larger.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical issues: privacy and openness</strong></p>\n<p>Two critical aspects of the Open Banking Standard concern privacy and openness. </p>\n<p>The standard framework calls on industry, government and consumers to improve data literacy and address security concerns so that data shared by customers is done so with informed consent. </p>\n<p>In promoting an open approach, the framework calls for tools, techniques and processes that are openly accessible, such as open APIs. In the weeks since the Open Banking Standard framework’s release, former ODI Startup Open Banking Project has already begun to <a href=\"https://uk.openbankproject.com/\">mock </a><a href=\"https://uk.openbankproject.com/\">up</a> an open banking API that respects the need for consent demonstrating the power and agility of open innovation.</p>\n<p><strong>Paving the way for a world-leading UK FinTech hub</strong></p>\n<p>To become and remain the leading global FinTech hub that Harriett Baldwin advocates the UK must remain focused on <a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/an-open-letter-to-the-chair-of-the-new-infrastructure-commission\">strengthening its data infrastructure</a>, and promoting open standards, open APIs and open innovation. Collaboration across government and the finance and tech sectors will be key to doing so effectively and ensuring the services work for everyone. </p>\n<p><em><strong>If you have ideas or experience in open data that you'd like to share, <a href=\"mailto:production@theodi.org\" title=\"pitch us a blog\">pitch us a blog</a> or tweet us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/odihq\" title=\"@ODIHQ\">@ODIHQ</a>.</strong></em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-banking-standard.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/open-banking-standard","slug":"open-banking-standard","title":"The Open Banking Standard","format":"article","updated_at":"2017-05-18T15:22:55+00:00","created_at":"2016-02-05T13:48:32+00:00","tag_ids":["page","open-banking","open-banking-working-group"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-banking-working-group-terms-of-reference.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/open-banking-working-group-terms-of-reference","slug":"open-banking-working-group-terms-of-reference","title":"Open Banking Working Group: Terms of Reference","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-10-06T09:49:47+00:00","created_at":"2015-10-02T15:54:28+00:00","tag_ids":["news","open-banking-working-group","finance"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-banking-working-group-panel-to-discuss-improving-banking-services-at-odi-lecture.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/open-banking-working-group-panel-to-discuss-improving-banking-services-at-odi-lecture","slug":"open-banking-working-group-panel-to-discuss-improving-banking-services-at-odi-lecture","title":"Open Banking Working Group panel to discuss improving banking services ","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-11-30T18:08:24+00:00","created_at":"2015-11-30T18:00:04+00:00","tag_ids":["news","open-banking-working-group","finance"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/finance.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/finance","slug":"finance","title":"Finance","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-02-09T14:15:04+00:00","created_at":"2015-10-14T12:25:19+00:00","tag_ids":["page","finance","open-banking-working-group","open-banking-standard"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/first-french-chief-data-officer-announced-at-odi-paris.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/first-french-chief-data-officer-announced-at-odi-paris","slug":"first-french-chief-data-officer-announced-at-odi-paris","title":"First French Chief Data Officer announced at ODI Paris","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:57:02+00:00","created_at":"2014-09-19T08:30:20+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>ODI Paris today (19th September) hosted French Secretary of State Thierry Mandon as he announced that Henri Verdier will be the first French Chief Data Officer.

Four organisations and one individual were recognised for their contribution to the worldwide open data movement.</p>\n<p>The awards were presented by the ODI’s Founders, Sirs Tim Berners-Lee and Nigel Shadbolt, in a ceremony attended by leaders from the business, data and technology worlds. </p>\n<p>Nominations for the awards were open to everyone and were judged by a team of six. The panel of judges included Dr Nick Appleyard, Head of Digital at Innovate UK; Andrew Fletcher, Senior Manager at Thomson Reuters Data Innovation Lab; Paul Maltby, Director of Open Data and Government Innovation at the UK Cabinet Office; Rahma Mian, Journalist and Stanford Knight fellow in Pakistan; Beth Noveck, Director of The Governance Lab at New York University; Dr David Tarrant, Senior Trainer at the Open Data Institute.</p>\n<p>The chair for the awards was Kathryn Corrick, Head of Content &amp; Learning at the ODI, whom commented:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“We received hundreds of entries for this year’s open data awards, who, excitingly, came from all over the world. All of them are pioneers. This year’s winners demonstrate, in particular, the power of open data to make a difference - be it social, environmental or economic. I am so delighted to be celebrating their work and the contribution so many people are making in using and publishing open data to make a local and global impact”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The trophies awarded tonight were cut and carved from five British hardwood by Martin Cottis, making them completely unique.</p>\n<p>The first to receive one of these special trophies were the winners of the Open Data Business Award, which celebrates how open data can be used to benefit businesses’ efficiency and revenue. Runners up were <a href=\"http://publisher.theodi.org/admin/editions/545910cdd0d46207fd000003\">Socrata</a> and <a href=\"https://opencorporates.com/\">OpenCorporates</a>. The winner was credited by one judge as ‘“knowing data is not valuable without being able to deliver insight.” The award went to <a href=\"http://geolytix.co.uk/\">Geolytix</a>, whom stated </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“This Open Data award is a fantastic recognition of the many hours the whole team have put in to building our datasets, which we believe are the best in the market because of Open Data.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Following in Geolytix’s footsteps was Irina Bolychevski who won the Open Data Individual Champion Award for her work with <a href=\"http://ckan.org/\">CKAN</a>. She says the award will coincide with the product’s growth and expressed her gratitude: </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"It's fantastic to have this recognised by the Open Data Institute Awards since we are very much aligned in growing the open data ecosystem for all.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Open Data Publisher Award was then announced by Sir Nigel Shadbolt - the finalists were <a href=\"https://data.ny.gov/\">Open NY</a>, <a href=\"http://www.epimorphics.com/web/\">Epimorphics</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page\">WikiData</a>. WikiData were presented with the award “for sheer scale, and built-in openness”. Lydia Pintscher from WikiData outlined the projects’s hopes for the future: </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“We hope that a lot more people will become aware of our work and join us on our way to bringing free knowledge to everyone.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Building on this promising hope for the world of open data were <a href=\"http://www.gaugemap.co.uk/\">Shoothill</a>, who won the Open Data Innovation Award. Shoothill was the first firm in the UK to work on developing software based on the live flood data from the Environment Agency, and was accredited by one judge as being “a great tool to keep people informed and protected from flooding”.</p>\n<p>Finally, for positive social influence, the Open Data Social Impact Award was awarded to <a href=\"http://www.plantwise.org/\">Plantwise</a>; a global programme aiming to promote food security and improve rural living through the reduction of crop losses. Shaun Hobbs from Plantwise said: </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“This award will help us continue to build the profile for agricultural data sharing, and open data for other forms of development around the world.”\n  The Open Data Awards demonstrated a hopeful encouragement for individuals and companies worldwide to participate in the practice of publishing and exploiting open data. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ukodi/15535665287/player/\" width=\"484\" height=\"640\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/food-for-thought-an-opportunity-to-champion-the-next-open-data-challenge.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/food-for-thought-an-opportunity-to-champion-the-next-open-data-challenge","slug":"food-for-thought-an-opportunity-to-champion-the-next-open-data-challenge","title":"Food for thought: Opportunity to champion the next Open Data Challenge","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:55:52+00:00","created_at":"2014-06-12T11:45:41+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>The Open Data Institute and Nesta are pleased to announce a paid opportunity for an individual to support the delivery of the Food Open Data Challenge which will be launched in July 2014.

The project is supported and funded by the Cabinet’s Office Release of Data Fund and strengthens the UK’s position as a world leader in open data. </p>\n<p>Between June and August 2014, the ODI conducted an initial scoping phase for the Open Addresses UK project to assess its longer-term feasibility. This work included technical scoping, an assessment of data available for free in the public domain, and an Open Addresses Symposium held by the ODI in August 2014.  </p>\n<p>From today, individuals and organisations are being invited to collaborate in developing and maintaining the sustainable address list by submitting data.

Our aim is, and will always be, to develop a conceptually and structurally innovative platform for people to contribute to, by uploading and sharing open address data or developing their own applications using it.\" </p>\n<p><strong>Why the UK needs open addresses</strong></p>\n<p>The need for a free, open address database has been well documented within Open Data User Group (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/open-data-user-group\">ODUG</a>) business cases and in the<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/274979/bis-14-513-open-national-address-gazetteer.pdf\"> recent report</a> on an Open Address Gazetteer, written for the UK Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). </p>\n<p>Heather Savory, Chair of ODUG said: \"One of the first benefits cases ODUG developed in 2012 was a call on the government to deliver an open national address dataset. Address data is a key underpinning component of our National Information Infrastructure, essential to connecting other datasets together for analysis, without the need for personal identifiers, to underpin the evidence-based design of innovative, cost-effective public services; also to allow business innovation with other open public datasets to assist economic growth.</p>\n<p>The aim of the Open Addresses UK venture being launched today it to build a national address register which is free of monopoly intellectual property restrictions so this address data will be genuinely open. This project is a challenge but not one which is insurmountable and I hope it will receive the full support required to achieve the aim of delivering a truly open national address register, free at the point of use and for re-use by anyone. That would be a fabulous result for us all.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Photo competition</strong> </p>\n<p>To promote the new address list and encourage people to donate addresses for inclusion, Open Addresses UK is launching a photography competition, highlighting the rich diversity of locations across the UK. People are being asked to submit original photographs of addresses that will then be used to illustrate the work of Open Addresses UK and will be promoted across digital and social media channels. The competition will be judged by a panel including renowned photographer, <a href=\"http://paulclarke.com/photography/\">Paul Clarke</a>. it is open to anyone and more information is available on the Open Addresses UK <a href=\"http://www.openaddressesuk.org\">website</a>.</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/french-president-talks-open-data-with-odi-paris-and-odi-supporter-snips-at-exclusive-honorary-lunch.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/french-president-talks-open-data-with-odi-paris-and-odi-supporter-snips-at-exclusive-honorary-lunch","slug":"french-president-talks-open-data-with-odi-paris-and-odi-supporter-snips-at-exclusive-honorary-lunch","title":"French President talks open data with ODI Paris and ODI Supporter, Snips, at exclusive honorary lunch","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:55:20+00:00","created_at":"2014-04-25T09:07:54+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>FivebyFive, the Open Data Institute’s Paris ‘Node’, and Snips, an ODI Supporter have today (25th April) been recognised as leading lights amongst France’s new wave of open data entrepreneurs.

Snips enables connected products to offer a personalized user experience by turning location data into context. </p>\n<p>The Presidential event comes in the same week as the <a href=\"http://www.laconferencedeparis.com/\">Paris Conference on Open Data and Open Government</a> where France joined the <a href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/\">Open Government Partnership</a>. Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude, ODI CEO Gavin Starks and FivebyFive’s Kat Borlongan all spoke at the conference about the potential for open data, and the importance of openness and transparency.  </p>\n<p><strong>Gavin Starks, ODI CEO said</strong> </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Open data in France has taken a huge leap forward this week. Today’s Presidential event with ODI Paris and Snips, and the fact that France has joined the OGP, show that the French government is acting to catalyse the huge business opportunities that open data can bring; to drive open innovation and better services for French citizens. We look forward to seeing the French government support startup companies working with open data to reach their potential.   </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Francis Maude, Cabinet Office Minister, welcomed France’s move to join the OGP in his <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/francis-maude-welcomes-france-to-the-open-government-partnership\">speech </a>and commented:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Open Data Institute, started in London by Sir Tim Berners-Lee and Sir Nigel Shadbolt, is now operating here in Paris too. It’s a great example of how much we can do together. By operating across different countries, it can unlock the best supplies of data, generate demand and enhance our knowledge of its potential to address common issues.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Kat Borlongan, co-founder of FivebyFive said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It's almost shocking how many complex problems open data can solve. It's a big step forward for FivebyFive, as a young startup, to be invited to sit down with the President over lunch and not just tell him but show him what we mean. It sends a strong signal to the open data community as a whole and makes us even more hopeful for the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Rand Hindi from Snips said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is a real honour to be invited to discuss such important topics with the French President. As a startup specialising in modelling how people and cities interact, we rely heavily on open data to build contextual models of urban environments. We can already predict passenger flow in public transport, car accidents and crime. The more data we can access, the more problems we can solve, thus contributing to making cities a better place to live.</p>\n</blockquote>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/about-nodes.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/about-nodes","slug":"about-nodes","title":"ODI Nodes","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-07-06T08:45:31+00:00","created_at":"2013-10-23T11:22:16+00:00","tag_ids":["page","node","nodes","international"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/node-knowledge-november-2013.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/node-knowledge-november-2013","slug":"node-knowledge-november-2013","title":"Node Knowledge… November 2013","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-03-02T10:28:39+00:00","created_at":"2013-11-18T17:58:57+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","nodes","network","global","gavin-starks"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-node-knowledge-feb-2014.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-node-knowledge-feb-2014","slug":"odi-node-knowledge-feb-2014","title":"Node knowledge - Feb 2014","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:54:50+00:00","created_at":"2014-02-22T21:35:57+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/from-seoul-to-osaka-asia-pacific-opens-arms-to-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/from-seoul-to-osaka-asia-pacific-opens-arms-to-open-data","slug":"from-seoul-to-osaka-asia-pacific-opens-arms-to-open-data","title":"From Seoul to Osaka - Asia Pacific opens arms to open data as ODI announces five new international Nodes","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:58:23+00:00","created_at":"2014-02-17T11:39:20+00:00","tag_ids":["news","nodes","international"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/nodes.json","web_url":null,"title":"nodes","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=nodes","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/nodes","slug":"nodes"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/international.json","web_url":null,"title":"international","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=international","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/international","slug":"international"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>The ODI has announced five new international Nodes including the first two from the Asia Pacific region: Osaka, Seoul, Sheffield, Philadelphia and Hawaii.

It’s our belief that it’s a matter of ratios. The greater good for information assets in general is for them to be open,\" Nigel said.</p>\n<p><strong>Building a data infrastructure</strong></p>\n<p>Promoting the concept of <a href=\"http://theodi.org/who-owns-our-data-infrastructure\">information and data as important infrastructure</a> was described by Nigel as \"critical\", a sentiment echoed by Gavin, who stressed the importance of openness to its use, reach and value. “A lot of this is about technology getting out of the way,” he said. \"It’s important to recognise that technology will not save us … [what's] really powerful is when you provide your citizens, business and civil servants with the information, insights and tools to solve a problem.\"</p>\n<p>It takes all sorts of people, groups and businesses to make up this infrastructure, using and producing open data for others to build upon. But which are the most compelling incentives for business and governments to invest in using open data and publishing more of their own?</p>\n<p><strong>Getting industry onboard: how open data benefits business</strong></p>\n<p>There is an increasing number of companies looking to do more in open data. \"We have exemplars, hard-headed businesses like <a href=\"https://directory.theodi.org/members/DR9300KI\">Thomson Reuters</a>, like <a href=\"https://directory.theodi.org/members/AQ1298ST\">Experian</a>, who have got real open data ambition and see the power of open innovation,\" Nigel said, referencing ODI Members. </p>\n<p>This is one of the big shifts the ODI has seen in the last two years, with 250 ODI Members exploring the potential of using and producing more open data. \"It’s the automation of business, basically,\" as Tim put it.  </p>\n<p>Gavin went on to discuss ‘<a href=\"http://theodi.org/open-data-means-business\">Open data means business</a>’, a report the ODI published earlier this year which surveyed 270 companies across the UK on how they used or produced open data. \"Half of them are sharing data with each other, consuming open data from other businesses,\" he explained.</p>\n<p>\"When we look at what kind of questions pharmaceutical companies, banks, construction firms or consultancies are asking, it’s how to reduce friction in the economy and how we bring more productivity to organisations. We’re working with companies to map their own data inventory, looking at what is shared, what is closed and what is open. When you move from closed to shared to open, you increase the number of people you can engage within your market.\" </p>\n<p>The businesses that will succeed in the future are those that embrace ‘network thinking’ from day one, according to Gavin:</p>\n<p>\"It’s exactly the same strategy that <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/uk/shop?afid=p238%7CsaOVFdZd6-dc_mtid_187079nc38483_pcrid_78816792493_&cid=aos-uk-kwg-brand-slid-\">Apple</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps?utm_source=emea_Med&utm_medium=hasem&utm_content=Apr2815&utm_campaign=Evergreen&pcampaignid=MKT-EG-emea-uk-all-Med-hasem-ap-Evergreen-Apr2815-1%2EHASEM_kwid_43700007009447167&gclid=CJCq05ry-sYCFXEotAodAYYP3g&gclsrc=ds#/now\">Google</a> used to build their app stores. If you commoditise this layer of access, the data will enable others to build completely new products and services on top. Once that is established you have a value chain. Once you have a value chain you have an economy built on that data.\"</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/b7/5e/55b75efa1f986a084100000b/tim2.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img text-center\" id=\"55b75efaf362be77aa000016\">\n<Small>“Building communities around products and services is the future – you can’t do that in a closed ecosystem.” ODI CEO Gavin Starks. Photo: <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" title=\"CC BY 2.0\">CC BY 2.0</a>, by [Paul Clarke for the ODI](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ukodi/sets/72157655306322560 “Paul Clarke for the ODI\").</small></p>\n<p>For companies, building this value chain by opening data may well end up being vital to their sustainability and future, as more purchasing decisions become automated and data-driven. </p>\n<p>\"Imagine you’re a corporate person who doesn’t want to have a budget for open data,\" said Tim.\" What budget would you have for advertising? \"It’s likely to be a massive one … We put a huge amount of energy into telling people about our products. But we’re discovering that more and more people are actually buying things with machines, [where] the buying process [consists of] pulling all the information you can about products, running optimisation over it and basing the sale on that. Businesses are being automated with the transfer of data. If you don’t have data about your products out there, you disappear.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Where does ‘big data’ fit in?</strong></p>\n<p>‘Big data’ is a vendor-driven term we hear more and more at the ODI, as organisations spanning broad sectors see it as \"the answer\" to their digital and strategic growth, as Nigel puts it. But companies investing in big data initiatives before considering how to build value with open is “nonsensical”, Gavin said, as “building communities around products and services is the future of marketing, the future of development, and you can’t do that in a closed ecosystem.”</p>\n<p><strong>Building the data infrastructure: the role and benefits for government</strong></p>\n<p>Governments must play a key role in identifying, enabling and releasing core datasets and registries for our data infrastructure to be sustainable. Tim and Nigel emphasised the direct and indirect benefits governments stood to gain from such a process.</p>\n<p>\"It’s made a lot of public services more efficient,\" Nigel said. \"A classic example is the health service, where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/may/29/open-data-nhs-healthcare-nigel-shadbolt\">publication of infection rates in hospitals</a> actually drove improvement.\" </p>\n<p>Tim raised the \"classic\" example of open data improving use and efficiencies of transport systems. He stressed that while we’re used to navigating painlessly across London with open data-driven apps like CityMapper, the lack of open data in many places makes this quite unique. “How sad is that?” he asked. A sentiment shared by CityMapper General Manager Omid Ashtari when <a href=\"http://theodi.org/news/citymapper-government-open-data-improve-cities\">I spoke to him</a> at the Bloomberg Smarter Cities event earlier this month in London. Omid said that CityMapper had been developed initially in London purely due to the open data that existed here.</p>\n<p>Citymapper’s success is a positive outcome of a supportive supply chain and ecosystem built from open data. In this case, Transport for London (TfL) and others supply the data, TransportAPI brings it together as a commercial service (from ODI Startup <a href=\"https://theodi.org/start-ups/placr\">Placr</a>), and thousands of developers build apps (like Citymapper) on on top of that. This creates jobs and revenue streams within industry, and TfL ultimately benefits because people use public transport more efficiently.</p>\n<p><strong>Boosting regulation with transparency</strong></p>\n<p>Another benefit open data can bring to both the private and public sectors is the level of transparency it brings. When asked about the government’s appetite to keep banking data assets public as banks get privatised, Nigel championed transparency as an important regulatory mechanism, something highlighted both by Prime Minister David Cameron and Gavin Starks in recent <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/06/05/david-cameron-urges-g7-to_n_7523130.html\">Huffington Post</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/jun/12/open-data-central-fifa-reform\">Guardian</a> articles, respectively. </p>\n<p>But as more public services are contracted out to the private sector, keeping hold of important datasets in the process is something Nigel refered to as \"vital\", especially as taxpayers often subsidise services even after privatisation. “Contracts [must] stipulate that the data doesn’t go with the service ... hang onto the data assets as a piece of public data infrastructure.”</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/133135007\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/133135007\">Gavin Starks: Keynote - Open Data Awards 2015</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/theodiuk\">Open Data Institute</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Paving the way for Generation Open</strong></p>\n<p>At the ODI we are exploring how to engage and mobilise Generation Open, an emerging group of global citizens who embrace network thinking.</p>\n<p>\"We see this reflected in the startups that apply to join our programme: small teams of people who can achieve astonishingly large-scale impact,\" Gavin said. \"<a href=\"https://opencorporates.com/\">OpenCorporates</a> is a great example of this, as a small team with hundreds of thousands of people using their service. That type of thinking really disrupts a lot of data-based businesses and, since we’ve digitised so much in the world, most businesses are data-based in some way.\"</p>\n<p>But with the growth of Gen O, its reach and capabilities comes the important task of priming people in broad sectors to maximise data’s value and handle it responsibly.</p>\n<p>\"We need to train the next generation in data ethics,\" Gavin explained. \"<a href=\"http://theodi.org/courses\">As we do at the ODI</a>, we need to train more public policymakers, more journalists, more lawyers, procurements officers and technology practitioners. Looking back to our vision of ‘knowledge for everyone’ we need to think about how everyone can engage with this in future. How can we do better than we did in the 90s, when we left a lot of people behind? Many are still not online, not literate in software engineering, so what skills do we need to build in primary, secondary and university education? How do we make sure that when it’s an election issue – and it should be an election issue: as to whether certain datasets are open, closed or shared, who owns them, and so on – that we have an informed population capable of an informed debate?\"</p>\n<p>There is a huge opportunity in enabling more and more people to engage in tackling these problems. The trend is that people who solve big problems are embracing network thinking.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/b7/60/55b760e2f362be08a300000e/awardscrowd.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img text-center\" id=\"55b760e21f986a61eb00000c\"> \n<Small>Guests at the 2015 Open Data Awards.

When we interact with our GPs and healthcare providers, we hope that our doctors and nurses know everything they need to know to help us get better. We want to get the best possible care and we want the experience to be as painless (in all senses) as possible. Better data-sharing between organisations and people who are providing medical care, and better use of health data – whether in the private or public sector – is going to be a necessary part of making this happen.</p>\n<p>Google’s DeepMind announced the launch of <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/health\">DeepMind Health</a> in <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/google-deepmind-sets-up-healthcare-team-acquires-hark-and-builds-new-app-2016-2\">early 2016</a>, aiming to improve direct patient care using data. </p>\n<p>There are positives in this: the NHS wants to improve patient care and keep people healthy, and DeepMind are very good at using and understanding the potential of data. But there’s also good reason to be cautious: there’s already suspicion around data projects that involve use of our medical records as a result of <a href=\"http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/your-practice/practice-topics/it/700000-patients-continue-to-have-data-sharing-objections-ignored/20031072.fullarticle\">other flawed initiatives</a>, and lack of trust that what’s being done with our data is secure, ethical, and ultimately for our benefit.</p>\n<p>Over the last week, Google’s collaboration with the Royal Free NHS Trust – which has involved providing DeepMind with access to updated and historical healthcare data on 1.6 million UK patients – has been <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2086454-revealed-google-ai-has-access-to-huge-haul-of-nhs-patient-data/\">making headlines of the wrong kind</a>. Their data-sharing agreement with Royal Free as part of DeepMind’s development of its service, Streams, was leaked to the public. While focused on Streams, an app helping staff monitor patients with kidney disease, the data-sharing agreement gave DeepMind access to a wider pool of updating and historic hospital data than seemed necessary.</p>\n<p>The potential benefits from this collaboration (improving direct patient care, specifically around Streams) remain persuasive. What has concerned people, and fuelled suspicions, is the lack of transparency around how their health data is being shared, with whom, for what purpose, and with what impact. This leads to a breakdown in trust, ultimately stifling of positive uses of our health data that we all want to see.</p>\n<p><strong>Maintaining trust in our healthcare providers</strong></p>\n<p>For healthcare systems to function, it’s essential that patients trust doctors with their confidential information. Current policy around data spells out some key principles, both on the rights of individuals and the duties of organisations. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-nhs-constitution-for-england/the-nhs-constitution-for-england\">NHS Constitution</a> outlines the right of patients to privacy, to be informed about how their information is being used and to opt out if they wish. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldicott_Report\">Caldicott Principles</a>, which were commissioned in 1997 due to concern about how information technology was affecting the way patients’ information was used, set out the responsibilities of organisations. They include \"justify[ing] the purpose\" of transferring data and “us[ing] the minimum necessary patient-identifiable data possible”.</p>\n<p>Critics of the data-sharing agreement between DeepMind and Royal Free have <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/04/concerns-raised-over-broad-scope-of-deepmind-nhs-health-data-sharing-deal/\">argued</a> that it fails to meet both of these conditions. Specifically, they say that the purpose of the deal was not clearly defined – which raises concerns about what the data will be used for, not least given that Google has access to other data with which NHS data could be combined – and that patients affected were not sufficiently informed to be able to opt out. DeepMind and <a href=\"https://www.royalfree.nhs.uk/news-media/news/google-deepmind-qa/\">Royal Free</a> have countered these claims, arguing that the agreement followed NHS information governance processes, connections to the information are encrypted, and patients can contact the Trust to opt out.</p>\n<p>What is clear is that this situation has been arrived at as a result of a <a href=\"http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures/friday-lunchtime-lecture-medconfidential-do-you-know-what-happens-to-your-medical-records\">lack of transparency</a>. Trust is an essential component of better data-sharing, and the demand for it in healthcare is acute. As Dame Caldicott said in a <a href=\"http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/events/digital-health-and-care-congress-2016/dame-fiona-caldicott\">King’s Fund interview</a> published on Tuesday: \"If the public is willing to trust health and care services with its data, there can be huge benefits for everyone … But there is little public awareness of the way that information is shared, and that trust has not yet been earned.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Openness about personal data can create trust</strong></p>\n<p>The ODI has been exploring openness and open data as a mechanism for improving trust in how data that is about us is used. Our <a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/bringing-together-privacy-and-openness-the-odi-shares-draft-personal-data-principles?utm_content=buffer060ac&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer\">personal data design principles</a> encourage organisations collecting and processing personal data to be open about what they are doing, how data will be kept secure, and how people might opt out of having their personal data used. Transparency around personal data processing and data portability are concepts at the core of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will be in force within the next two years.</p>\n<p>DeepMind almost certainly have the expertise and tools to store patient data securely, and treat its use with care. They outline some of their data security and privacy intentions on their <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/health\">website</a>, to help patients be \"certain that their health data is handled with the utmost care and respect at all times.\" They have a review board scrutinising their work every quarter.</p>\n<p>The problem is that people don’t like surprises. And right now, people don’t know whether they can trust DeepMind. A key part of building trust is showing people how you are storing, using and analysing their personal data in practice.</p>\n<p><strong>Open data-sharing by design</strong></p>\n<p>For DeepMind and Royal Free’s collaboration, being open about the nature of the project including data security and privacy, might have changed the debate we’re now having. Open by design might include proactively publishing information about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>the nature of the data being shared with DeepMind (both going forward and historic data)</p></li>\n<li><p>how many people in DeepMind have access to the data, the internal processes for keeping it secure and accountability mechanisms</p></li>\n<li><p>restrictions on how DeepMind can use the data</p></li>\n<li><p>what happens to the data at the end of the data-sharing agreement</p></li>\n<li><p>how people can get in touch to request deletion of their data</p></li>\n<li><p>their quarterly health review board meetings</p></li>\n<li><p>their data audit processes, and procedures in the case of [and any instances of] personal data leaks</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We now know lots of this information as a result of the leaking of the data-sharing agreement. How different might the story have been if transparency was routine, and there were mechanisms for feedback?</p>\n<p>Royal Free could openly publish data about the data-sharing agreements they have in place with other organisations. They could create an open call for key challenges they face where data might help, supported by an open tendering process. These mechanisms would help other organisations, researchers and healthcare providers to see where they might be able to help. The NHS information governance department could make open publication of information about personal data-sharing mandatory for any data-sharing to take place.</p>\n<p>If we are to realise the potential of data to transform healthcare, or other sensitive fields, we must bridge this data-trust deficit.

Elegant and imaginative uses of data can make sure that decisions by professionals are transparent, accountable, and driven by evidence, as demonstrated by the work done on prescribing data this weekend. But the same kind of work can also ensure that healthy decisions are easy, as the tennis matchmaker shows”. Nigel Shadbolt added:</p>\n<p>“The great thing about a hack day is that it brings together innovators, developers and people with great ideas to focus on the data itself. The other thing it brings is a sense of common purpose – there’s a lot of networking between the various ideas. That happens when you bring people in to close proximity together over 2 or 3 days. Great ideas are born” <em>The winning team, Go-Hit-It-Off will be guest blogging on this site soon and if you would like to take part in the next ODI hackathon see <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/events\">ODI Events</a></em></p>\n<p><em>Photos: Brendan Lea</em></p>","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"David Tarrant","slug":"david-tarrant","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/david-tarrant","tag_ids":["team","learning-programme","staff"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"David Tarrant","slug":"david-tarrant","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/david-tarrant","tag_ids":["team","learning-programme","staff"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/how-can-open-data-portals-become-sustainable-new-report-makes-recommendations-from-design-to-evaluation.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/how-can-open-data-portals-become-sustainable-new-report-makes-recommendations-from-design-to-evaluation","slug":"how-can-open-data-portals-become-sustainable-new-report-makes-recommendations-from-design-to-evaluation","title":"How can open data portals become sustainable?

They enable data-holders to publish data so that people can find and use it. We use portals to publish and discover all sorts of data. </p>\n<p>With a reliable supply of data businesses and governments can build apps and services that citizens benefit from and come to rely on. Portals therefore play a vital role in allowing data to flow freely and <a href=\"http://theodi.org/the-value-of-open-data\">create value</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>The way that people discover data is changing</strong></p>\n<p>In the medium term, data is being made available through multiple portals so users can find it more easily. Regional portals, community portals and national portals increasingly publish data or metadata from other portals. The <a href=\"https://www.europeandataportal.eu/\">European Data Portal</a>, which was launched in 2015, harvests metadata from national portals to make data more accessible. Driving these initiatives is portability: making data discoverable through multiple portals will help maximise its value.</p>\n<p>In the longer term, how people discover data will change more radically. Publishing and searching for data on the web is still in its infancy. We don’t know yet how the web of data will evolve, but we can look at <a href=\"https://theodi.org/blog/we-need-to-learn-how-to-search-the-web-of-data\">how we search the web of documents has evolved</a>, from early portals such as DMOZ and Yahoo! to the page-rank style search we have today. New tools such as <a href=\"https://octopub.io/\">Octopub</a> are emerging that allow people to publish to the web of data. </p>\n<p>As the way we publish and search for data evolves, so too will the role of portals. </p>\n<p><strong>Embedding sustainability: from design to evaluation</strong></p>\n<p>Portals’ sustainability – how they respond and adapt to challenges – is therefore important. Yet most portals were created quickly as part of a politically driven open data initiative, without feasibility studies, business cases, strategy or user research. Many were built simply because governments felt they ought to have one. In short, most were set up without sustainability in mind.</p>\n<p>Portals have sought to address this in myriad ways. They have worked closely with user communities to prioritise data publication, developed business cases to win over politicians, made technical updates to ensure that data publication processes are scalable, and developed and automated ways of measuring their progress.</p>\n<p>However, most have not yet embedded sustainability into their design and processes in a holistic way. This means building sustainability into how they are governed, how they are financed, their architecture, their operations and the metrics that monitor their progress. </p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.europeandataportal.eu/sites/default/files/edp_s3wp4_sustainability_recommendations.pdf\">report</a> we set out recommendations in each of these areas, based on interviews with portal owners across Europe. By sharing common experiences and best practice, we hope to enable portals to learn from one another. </p>\n<p><em>We will repeat the research at the end of 2017 to test the usefulness of our recommendations and look more closely at certain areas.

More connectivity is needed to ensure that problems in cities are met by solutions, and innovation is not stifled or siloed. <strong>Open data is needed to achieve more resilient cities that are effective, inclusive and productive.</strong></p>\n<p>To help understand the potential impact of open data on improving city resilience globally, we need to bring together existing case studies, stories and experience. Through this we seek to begin a discussion among policymakers, city planners, technologists and open data experts, to drive changes in policy and practice towards ultimately strengthening city resilience and improving urban life for citizens. </p>\n<p>This research tender process is being led by the ODI, an independent, nonprofit, founded by Sirs Tim Berners-Lee and Nigel Shadbolt. The ODI convenes world-class experts from industry, government and academia to connect, equip and inspire people around the world to innovate with data. </p>\n<p>Funding for this work is provided by OD4D (with funding from the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), World Bank, Global Affairs Canada and The Department for International Development (DFID)).

The research is based on the original investment in the ODCS from the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, of £1.2m.  </p>\n<p>Over 3 years, the report predicts the programme will result in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>A return of £5 - £10 to the UK economy, for every £1 invested, this equates to a generation of £5.3m to £10.8m (GVA) </p></li>\n<li><p>The creation of 75 to 141 jobs</p></li>\n<li><p>Potential to generate further significant wider social and environmental impacts</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ODCS challenges were based around the following seven themes: Crime and Justice, Education, Energy and Environment, Housing, Food, Heritage and Culture and Jobs. Startups, SMEs and individuals were invited to define the challenge with programme leaders, then develop solutions using available open data from the public and private sectors. Each challenge had three finalists winning £5000, and one final winner securing up to £50,000 to develop their business, as well as benefiting from a tailored support package. </p>\n<p>Tools and services developed by the Open Data Challenge Series winners include: <a href=\"http://www.skillsroute.com/\">Skills Route</a>, a personalised service to help young people see how well they could do on courses they might take at local schools or colleges, and weigh up their higher education and career options. A new app for house hunters: <a href=\"http://www.movemakerapp.co.uk/\">Movemaker</a>, which helps people living in social housing swap their properties. And <a href=\"http://cultureeverywhere.com/?utm_source=odcs&utm_medium=press&utm_campaign=odcsculturewin\">Culture Everywhere</a> which helps organisations deliver better social outcomes through culture, by making it quick and easy for them to develop fundable projects (for a list of all ODCS winners, see notes to editors). A revised version of the <a href=\"http://opendatachallenges.org/resources/#comboFilters%5Bcolor%5D=\">ODCS Handbook</a>, which outlines all the challenge winners can be found here, it also contains advice for readers who may be interested in running a challenge of their own.</p>\n<p><strong>Martha Lane Fox said:</strong> </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This report shows how startup businesses are creating surprising new citizen services with open data, that have the potential to be commercially very successful. Demonstrating the value of open data to the UK economy is important - we need buy-in from Government, we need businesses to be enthused about not just using, but publishing high quality data, and we need to raise the level of data literacy across all sections of society\". </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gavin Starks, CEO at the Open Data Institute, said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We know that data is the fuel of open innovation. By providing a clear and structured mentoring environment around fantastic ideas and people, the ODCS team have helped transform them into tangible businesses. They are creating jobs, and bringing new ideas to market that provide social, environmental and economic impact”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Helen Goulden, Executive Director of Nesta's Innovation Lab said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Open Data Challenge Series has developed a replicable model\n  that we hope will drive real, quantifiable, social and economic\n  value from exploiting open data. We've applied the process to\n  fields as diverse as employment, food, education and crime with\n  some great results and my sense is that we have only just scratched the surface of what might be possible.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The Open Data Institute connect, equip and inspire people around the world to innovate with data.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://theodi.org/about-us\" title=\"Who is the ODI?\">Who is the ODI?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://theodi.org/newsletters\" title=\"Receive our newsletters\">Receive our newsletters</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://theodi.org/courses\" title=\"Learn about open data on our courses\">Learn about open data on our courses</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://theodi.org/membership\" title=\"Become an ODI member\">Become an ODI member</a></li>\n</ul>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/about-us.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/about-us","slug":"about-us","title":"About the ODI","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-12-13T14:10:00+00:00","created_at":"2013-10-22T22:44:14+00:00","tag_ids":["page","open-data-institute"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/newsletters.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/newsletters","slug":"newsletters","title":"Newsletters","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-08T14:17:01+00:00","created_at":"2013-10-25T10:55:24+00:00","tag_ids":["page"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/courses.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/courses","slug":"courses","title":"Courses","format":"article","updated_at":"2017-04-27T12:05:53+00:00","created_at":"2014-12-11T10:53:24+00:00","tag_ids":["page","courses","homepage"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/join-us.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/join-us","slug":"join-us","title":"ODI Membership","format":"article","updated_at":"2017-05-03T13:45:00+00:00","created_at":"2013-03-04T08:47:46+00:00","tag_ids":["page","members","membership"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/invitation-to-tender-odine-impact-evaluation.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/invitation-to-tender-odine-impact-evaluation","slug":"invitation-to-tender-odine-impact-evaluation","title":"Invitation to tender: ODINE impact evaluation","format":"article","updated_at":"2017-02-07T09:06:43+00:00","created_at":"2017-02-06T17:54:20+00:00","tag_ids":["news","invitation-to-tender","odine","startups"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/invitation-to-tender.json","web_url":null,"title":"invitation to tender","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=invitation-to-tender","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/invitation-to-tender","slug":"invitation-to-tender"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/odine.json","web_url":null,"title":"odine","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=odine","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/odine","slug":"odine"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/startups.json","web_url":null,"title":"startups","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=startups","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/startups","slug":"startups"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"The [Open Data Incubator for Europe](https://opendataincubator.eu/) (ODINE) is a 6-month incubator for open data entrepreneurs across Europe.

Your varied career has given you insight into lots of different industries. Have you noticed any running themes in how data is used and analysed within them?</strong></p>\n<p>We're seeing a positive trend in putting data to practical use. People from all sectors are figuring out how to take it out of the realm of abstract analysis and apply it to real world problems. That's going to bring a lot of rapid progress in healthcare, finance, energy, education and many other areas.</p>\n<p><strong>While working for the US Government, you helped pioneer ‘smart disclosure’ – giving consumers useful data to make informed decisions. What were your biggest challenges in this process?</strong></p>\n<p>The vast majority of consumers can't use data from government sources directly. So we need third-party intermediaries who can set up ‘choice engines’ that take the data and turn it into actionable information. Fortunately, that's a good business model that a number of new companies are starting to develop.</p>\n<p><strong>What will you be talking about at the ODI Summit?</strong></p>\n<p>I look forward to sharing what we've learned at The GovLab in our work on the Open Data 500 – our study of companies that use open government data as a key business resource. We're finding that this work can apply to other countries as well, and is also the basis for a new kind of dialogue between government agencies that provide data and the companies and organisations that use it. </p>\n<p><strong>Which other sessions are you most looking forward to, and why?</strong></p>\n<p>Of course, I'm eager to hear Sir Tim Berners-Lee talk about <a href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/sessions/25-years-of-the-world-wide-web/\" title=\"the last 25 years of the World Wide Web\">the last 25 years of the World Wide Web</a>. I'm also interested to hear the panel discussion on <a href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/sessions/future-proofing-governments-open-data/\" title=\"future-proofing governments for open data\">future-proofing governments for open data</a>. The panel on <a href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/sessions/open-data-for-social-impact-panel_/\" title=\"open data for social good\">open data for social good</a> is also an important one. We have to be sure that we keep the social dimension in mind as we look at the business applications of open data as well. </p>\n<p><strong>What direction do you see open data heading in over the next five years, and what most excites you about its future?</strong></p>\n<p>We're seeing a lot of new companies starting up that can work with government agencies to make their data easier to find and use. So I think that open data will become much more manageable very quickly, to everybody's benefit. That opens the way to working on making the data as accurate, timely, and useful as it can be. </p>\n<p><strong>As more councils, cities and countries open up their data, which sector do you think stands to gain the most, and why?</strong></p>\n<p>The best candidate for open data transformation is healthcare. We could soon see a world where data transforms everything from the way people choose their healthcare providers to the way doctors diagnose disease and prescribe treatments. We're heading into an era of personalised medicine, where open data combines with personal data to give each patient the treatment that's going to be most likely to be helpful to them.</p>\n<p><em>Joel will be talking about <a href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/sessions/open-data-500-generating-new-business-products-and-services/\" title=\"using open data to generate new business, products and services\">using open data to generate new business, products and services</a> at the <a href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/\" title=\"ODI Summit conference\">ODI Summit conference</a> at BFI Southbank, London, on Saturday, 4 November.

We also provide guidance on country-level analysis and how to search for solutions to problems. </p>\n<p><strong>Bringing aid data to the masses (not just the data geeks)</strong></p>\n<p>We develop tools like the <a href=\"http://data.aidspan.org/\" title=\"Aidspan Portal Workbench\">Aidspan Portal Workbench</a> (an online data filter portal) to help the public to access data used internally by Aidspan staff to analyse Global Fund data – a unique aspect for a watchdog agency. This allows end users to do their own analyses to support or counter what is published by Aidspan. Other tools include the <a href=\"http://www.aidspan.org/page/global-fund-overview\" title=\"Grant Portfolio\">Grant Portfolio</a> tool which analyses grant data by country, disease or region and the <a href=\"http://www.aidspan.org/page/grant-performance-analysis\" title=\"Grant Performance Analysis\">Grant Performance Analysis</a> tool which analyses grant performance against set indicators.</p>\n<p>My work as a watchdog is made somewhat easier by the Global Fund’s admirable transparency and accountability policy that has offered Aidspan the opportunity to access as much data as possible from the Global Fund. Simply put, we help others avoid the indigestion they would get from making sense of huge chunks of data on grant finances and programme performance. We do this by developing easy-to-use platforms that get the user through what could have been maddeningly complex otherwise. </p>\n<p><strong>Global Fund spending and its implications for global health</strong></p>\n<p>Making such effort is important. With annual spending of nearly US$3bn, the Global Fund money cannot easily be ignored in many recipient countries. In Sub-Sahara Africa alone, for instance, 44 countries receive more than 58% of the Fund’s global funding. </p>\n<p>Therefore analysing the flow of this money in relation to other country-level health financing data is important for those tracking how well health budgets are spent and how many lives saved as a result. </p>\n<p><strong>Setting the bar high in donor transparency</strong> </p>\n<p>Over the years, many smaller, less well-established organisations have become much more interested in exploring health financing data. This is presumably driven by a growing awareness of domestic financing in health and grants by large donors like the Fund and President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).</p>\n<p>Among these donors, the Global Fund remains one of the more transparent; providing access to its data via its <a href=\"http://web-api.theglobalfund.org/\" title=\"website\">website</a> and a number of other portals. However, despite the deluge of information, it can still be difficult to get more granular and reliable data that is easy to analyse. For instance, it is extremely difficult for watchdogs to track the flow of money or programme achievement at the implementation level. The data that exists is inconsistent, duplicative, incomplete and unreliable.</p>\n<p>Also, many watchdogs could but don’t make use of existing data from the Global Fund and from country-level implementers for analysis. Access barriers, inflexible formats and poor data skills pose the greatest challenges. </p>\n<p>The most critical way of overcoming these challenges is by enhancing data analysis and presentation expertise among national-level organisations interested in tracking the Global Fund, therefore increasing the number of people watching the Fund at country-level. There is a need to increase the number, consistency and quality of analysis being done at these levels and find more innovative ways of presenting what is usually dry, boring information. </p>\n<p>This will in turn increase watchdogs’ confidence in doing this work, help them prove their legitimacy in critiquing programme impact and efficacy and ultimately boost the degree of accountability and transparency within the Fund’s country-level systems.</p>\n<p>Granted, our expertise at Aidspan is focused on the Global Fund. But the same lessons about how to assess the impact of donor money or the efficacy of its grants and systems are applicable to many development initiatives around the world.</p>\n<p><em>Angela Kageni is Senior Programme Officer at Aidspan.

The purse concealed a sound recorder documenting each date and photograph presents the purse as an anecdotal monument encapsulating secret stories of married men.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>‘Fairytale for Sale’ (2011 - 2013)</strong> a series of defaced real wedding photos showing newlyweds performing ceremony traditions and iconic poses. Sourced online from redundant wedding dresses under resale by their owners, the obscured portraits question the transactional value of weddings as a performance and public displays of marriage.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>‘Love Bomb’ (2012 - 2014)</strong> - a photographic series of ‘love’ spells and potions, including an orange and lemon perforated with cloves and 9 carnations in a clear glass vase. The ‘spells and potions’ are juxtaposed with photographs of homemade bombs, and accompanying recipes. The project derives from Natasha’s own struggle to overcome lost love with a former partner and challenges the media-created expectation of living to achieve love.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>‘At First Sight’ (2014 - 2015)</strong> - photographic reenactments of falling in love at first sight, accompanied with circulation system diagrams and photographs of locations used for psychological love experiments. The piece is inspired by Natasha’s own love at first sight experience when meeting her recently wed husband in 2014.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Natasha Caruana said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"I live my art life with a day-to-day attitude never knowing what might come next. Working with open data will throw me into a new realm of research. As yet I have no exact idea what project will be produced at the ODI.

In March 2015 the programme expanded by welcoming its first artists in residence, Thomson &amp; Craighead, to launch its third Data as Culture theme: ‘Data Anthropologies’.</p>\n<p>The theme examines the complex and often unconscious relationships between people and data. Caruana will develop a new open data themed work, with access to the full ODI team, including researchers, data scientists, policy experts, developers, startup entrepreneurs, and supported with formal open data training.</p>\n<p><strong>Hannah Redler, Curator in Residence at the ODI said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Artists play a key role in unearthing unexpected meanings in current and emerging cultures, including how we engage with open data. Natasha’s sustained emotional involvement is integral to her performance,research and ability to turn personal events into universal concerns. By extracting emotions entangled in everyday technology, Natasha reminds us of how accepting we are of our immersion in technology .”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gavin Starks, CEO at the ODI said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“We like people who challenge our perception of data. Natasha’s works draw us into unexpected worlds, investigates our psychology, and reframes personal moments that – once private or only witnessed in trusted environments – are now available to the world, at-scale, forever. I look forward to seeing how she might rewire our preconceptions of privacy, transform our sense of moment, or upturn our notion of open.”   </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Data as Culture is open for visitors</strong></p>\n<p>Following the private view on 16 July 2015, the exhibition will be open to the public during Monday to Friday office hours from 17 July - 16 December 2015. Visitors must contact the ODI ahead of visiting on 020 3598 9395, or dac@theodi.org.

It is also blurring the traditional roles of business, government and NGOs by highlighting our collective responsibility to address acute global challenges. Above all, the data will be of value to farmers, enabling them to increase productivity sustainably and to enhance their livelihoods.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Jeni Tennison, Deputy CEO and CTO of the Open Data Institute, said:</em> </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Open data has the power to solve our most challenging sustainability problems. For example, how can we provide all the world’s people with adequate nutrition, whilst protecting our precious natural resources? Agri-tech businesses have a big role to play in finding novel solutions to these problems. It is encouraging that Syngenta is taking a step that puts them at the forefront of the open data movement in their sector. We look forward to working with them to unlock benefits for farmers and consumers worldwide.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Syngenta has standardized the published data and is working with the ODI to create a common language around the collection, measurement and sharing of crop-level information. This will improve understanding of how to best to deliver The Good Growth Plan commitments, which include helping to feed a growing global population by making crops more efficient while rescuing farmland and helping biodiversity flourish. </p>\n<p><em>Access the data from The Good Growth Plan <a href=\"http://www.syngenta.com/global/corporate/en/GoodGrowthPlanData/Pages/progress.aspx\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><small><i>Image is licensed under a (CC-BY-SA-2.0) license - <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mcdermottd/210837015/in/photolist-56Ptna-jCAuX-cUYyBm-dDFK4z-9VddDJ-fFKfDo-d159cu-9TAmXc-oSkHQy-a6ZGgf-a6WPUp-5BrTLT-8yG3jy-df4P8F-pu9HK-5uXP57-drYRMA-a6WQ4X-adEcJj-59UzC3-7K9N6F-64dNbX-9FawFo-8poKMD-sas694-8HZSis-8poKJX-8poKT6-nYWmHE-6jCoyt-cGVbAj-7K9N8c-o5U11U-6TS8NS-9Zrji9-dWPPP6-h8dJZ9-dgES5B-7KdGHQ-a6ZGbL-8poKPc-qrceYZ-o9gikL-f7dHs5-8poKW8-hP2w1y-rFpU-oLpqEr-otVKKT-ccY5TG\" title=\"Flickr: David McDermott\">Flickr: David McDermott</a></i></small></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"Access the data from The Good Growth Plan","url":"http://www.syngenta.com/global/corporate/en/GoodGrowthPlanData/Pages/progress.aspx"}],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/new-data-analysis-by-odi-startup-shows-uk-businesses-starved-of-22bn-in-cash-flow.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/new-data-analysis-by-odi-startup-shows-uk-businesses-starved-of-22bn-in-cash-flow","slug":"new-data-analysis-by-odi-startup-shows-uk-businesses-starved-of-22bn-in-cash-flow","title":"ODI startup reveals UK businesses starved of £22bn in cash flow by government inefficiencies","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:53:24+00:00","created_at":"2014-03-09T21:59:50+00:00","tag_ids":["news","business","open-data","government","uk"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/business.json","web_url":null,"title":"business","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=business","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/business","slug":"business"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/open-data.json","web_url":null,"title":"open data","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=open-data","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/open-data","slug":"open-data"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/government.json","web_url":null,"title":"government","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=government","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/government","slug":"government"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/uk.json","web_url":null,"title":"UK","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=uk","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/uk","slug":"uk"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>ODI start-up, <a href=\"https://spendnetwork.com\">Spend Network</a> has revealed that up to £22bn of government cash, intended for the UK economy, is being delayed by an inefficient tendering system.

We applaud the steps that the European Union has already taken to open up datasets but there is more that they can do. Too many EU datasets, including the data that this research is based on, is still not provided in a truly open and useful manner. Doing so would enable us all to understand what the causes and solutions may be to help grow our SME economy.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Spend Network is calling on governments in the UK and EU to release specific information as open data:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Details about the closure of all EU tenders including information on whether they have been cancelled or awarded (at the moment only about 30% of UK tenders get a contract award notice specifying who won the work). </p></li>\n<li><p>Information on contracts, including where work has been awarded through government frameworks. Frameworks are short-lists of suppliers that are can be approached about specific pieces of work. There are many thousands of these across the EU and at the moment, there is no information about where a contract might have originated.</p></li>\n<li><p>Details of all government spending, with no monetary threshold (currently, most departments only publish their spending data over £25k). This should then be clearly linked to specific contracts, so it is possible to trace what money is being spent on which products and services from each supplier. </p></li>\n<li><p>A dataset with unique identifiers for every public sector body in the UK. Currently, there is no way to clearly identify every public body and so it is impossible to accurately link each organisation to specific contracts.</p></li>\n</ol>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[{"name":"Spend Network","slug":"spend-network","url_helper":"http://theodi.org/start-ups/spend-network"}],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[{"name":"Spend Network","slug":"spend-network","url_helper":"http://theodi.org/start-ups/spend-network"}],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/new-europewide-open-data-incubator-programme-offers-startups-100k-equity-free-funding.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/new-europewide-open-data-incubator-programme-offers-startups-100k-equity-free-funding","slug":"new-europewide-open-data-incubator-programme-offers-startups-100k-equity-free-funding","title":"New Europe-wide open data incubator programme offers startups €100k equity free funding","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:00:54+00:00","created_at":"2015-05-19T14:48:37+00:00","tag_ids":["news","odine","startups"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/odine.json","web_url":null,"title":"odine","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=odine","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/odine","slug":"odine"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/startups.json","web_url":null,"title":"startups","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=startups","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/startups","slug":"startups"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"UK open data entrepreneurs urged to apply \r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"","url":"","content":"<h2 id=\"ukopendataentrepreneursurgedtoapply\">UK open data entrepreneurs urged to apply##</h2>\n<p>The new EU-funded, <a href=\"http://opendataincubator.eu/\">Open Data Incubator for Europe (ODInE)</a> is calling out to startups across the UK and Europe, to apply for a place on its new programme with the chance to secure up to €100k in grant funding. </p>\n<p>The incubator programme, which is being announced at the <a href=\"http://www.www2015.it/\">World Wide Web Conference</a> in Florence, has places for 50 startup businesses over the next two years.

The findings from <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/open-data-means-business\"><strong><em>Open data means business: UK innovation across sectors and regions</em></strong></a> draw on 270 companies with a combined turnover of £92bn and over 500k employees, identified by the ODI as using, producing or investing in open data as part of their business. The project included desk research, surveys and interviews on the companies’ experiences.</p>\n<p><strong>Key findings from the research include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Companies using open data <strong>come from many sectors</strong>; over 46% from outside the information and communication sector. These include finance &amp; insurance, science &amp; technology, business administration &amp; support, arts &amp; entertainment, health, retail, transportation, education and energy.</p></li>\n<li><p>Almost half (49%) of the companies studied are <strong>based outside London</strong>. Those within London are spread across the city (not just 'Tech City' or Shoreditch).</p></li>\n<li><p>The most popular datasets for companies are <strong>geospatial/mapping data</strong> (57%), transport data (43%) and environment data (42%).</p></li>\n<li><p>39% of companies innovating with open data are <strong>over 10 years old</strong>, with some more than 25 years old, proving open data isn’t just for new digital startups.</p></li>\n<li><p>‘Micro-enterprises’ (businesses with fewer than 10 employees) represented 70% of survey respondents, demonstrating a <strong>thriving open data startup scene</strong>. These businesses are using it to create services, products and platforms. 8% of respondents were drawn from large companies of 251 or more employees.</p></li>\n<li><p>70% of companies surveyed use government open data, while almost half (49%) of the surveyed companies use open data from non-government sources, such as businesses, non-profits and community projects. 39% use a combination of government and non-governmental open data.</p></li>\n<li><p>The companies surveyed listed 25 different government sources for the data they use. Notably, <a href=\"https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/opendatadownload/products.html\">Ordnance Survey</a> data was cited most frequently, by 14% of the companies. The non-government source most commonly used was <a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/\">OpenStreetMap</a>, an openly licenced map of the world created by volunteers.</p></li>\n<li><p>80% and 70% of respondents respectively said that accuracy and the licensing of the data are crucial when deciding to use open data in their business.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5 companies using open data in interesting ways:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.adzuna.co.uk/\">Adzuna’s</a> Job Market Report allows job hunters to compare the availability of jobs in different areas of the country. Adzuna combines open data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) with its jobs data to generate new metrics such as jobseekers per vacancy by location.</p></li>\n<li><p>Data consultancy <a href=\"http://geolytix.co.uk/blog/category/open-data/geodata/supermarket-locations/\">Geolytix</a> has gathered and mapped data on over 10,000 supermarkets in the UK and published it as open data – allowing supermarkets to identify market competition and opportunities for new stores, and developers to create new services for shoppers.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://foodtrade.menu\">FoodTrade.Menu</a> allows small restaurants and caterers to ensure their menus comply with new allergen regulations by creating customer menus with the most up-to-date allergen information. It uses open data from the Food Standards Agency.</p></li>\n<li><p>Software company <a href=\"http://www.shoothill.com/\">Shoothill</a> is enabling residents in flood zones to monitor local river levels at 15 minute intervals with GaugeMap. The product is based on data from 2,400 river level monitoring gauges, each gauge is assigned a Twitter account for local citizens to follow.</p></li>\n<li><p>Mime Consultancy will launch <a href=\"http://www.skillsroute.com/\">Skills Route</a>, a new platform for schools in September, allowing students to see which local education providers are offering their chosen post-16 subjects and the grades they are likely to achieve at each, based on their predicted GCSE results. It even shows possible career paths thereafter and potential earnings. The platform uses open data from the Department for Education.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Open data strategies</strong></p>\n<p>The research shows that startups are critical disruptors, challengers and innovators in open data, as with all industries. They are exposing diverse business opportunities in open data but also exposing the challenges faced when working with a new resource. For example, FoodTrade uses open data to develop an allergen compliance tool, but also aspires to redesign the food system in a more sustainable way.</p>\n<p><strong>Sarah Hitchcock, Partner at Geolytix said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Open data has opened up the market, allowing GeoLytix to build novel products which underpin the strategies and models we develop with our customers and support our growth by enabling us to sell ‘value-add’ data at a more competitive price.

These Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will address major global issues including human rights, social inclusion and the environment. </p>\n<p>The white paper includes <strong>12 case studies</strong> from the developing world, where open data has contributed to specific improvements and outcomes - everything from tackling crop disease, to mapping the spread of ebola.</p>\n<p>However, the report also acknowledges problems in making success stories more widespread: a lack of high-quality data, a weak enabling environment (low connectivity, scarce technical skills, lack of support from political leaders etc); mismatch between the demand for open data and the availability of appropriate datasets; the digital divide between rich and poor; and a lack of metrics to track and quantify demonstrable impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Liz Carolan, International Development Manager at the ODI said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“This report shows how open data is solving old and established problems with new approaches. It demonstrates that open data really can fire innovation, in governments as well as the private sector. In order to make the sustainable development goals a reality, what we now need to see is governments, NGO’s, industry and communities coming together to push for the publication and use of open data.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Three areas of focus</strong></p>\n<p>The report identifies three areas where open data could have a significant impact in the next development agenda and beyond. A case study is given for each below, though the full 12 are available in the report and in the notes to editors below.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Informing evidence-based policy-making for better government services</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Case study:</strong> Protecting banana farmers’ livelihoods in Uganda\nOpen-sourced, open datasets (gathered via Ureport) on banana bacterial wilt in Uganda\n meant the government was able to quickly identify the most affected areas and direct the limited treatments for the disease to prevent further advances. </p>\n<p><strong>2. Boosting transparency to help monitor progress and tackle corruption</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Case study:</strong> Making aid more effective in Nepal\nIn June 2013, the Aid Management Platform was launched by the Nepalese Ministry of Finance to help monitor aid and budget spending. </p>\n<p><strong>3. Stimulating $13tn in economic growth, job creation and innovation</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Case study:</strong> Building smarter, more responsive cities in Latin America\nIn response to the 2010 floods in Rio de Janeiro, open data is now being used to inform city planning, transportation and emergency responses. </p>\n<p><strong>Recommendations</strong> </p>\n<p>The report makes recommendations for governments, donors and (international) NGOs – with the support of researchers, civil society and industry – on how to apply open data to enhance development processes:    </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reach global consensus around principles and standards, namely being ‘open by default’, using the Open Government Partnership’s Open Data Working Group as a global forum for discussion.</li>\n<li>Embed open data into funding agreements, ensuring that relevant, high-quality data is collected to report against the SDGs. Funders should mandate that data relating to performance of services, and data produced as a result of funded activity, be released as open data.    </li>\n<li>Build a global partnership for sustainable open data, so that groups across the public and private sectors can work together to build sustainable supply and demand for data in the developing world. </li>\n</ol>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/supporting-sustainable-development-with-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/supporting-sustainable-development-with-open-data","slug":"supporting-sustainable-development-with-open-data","title":"Supporting sustainable development with open data","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-10-31T15:11:17+00:00","created_at":"2015-02-10T16:40:53+00:00","tag_ids":["page","whitepaper","research","sustainable","development"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/new-research-exposes-risk-privatising-land-registry-restricting-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/new-research-exposes-risk-privatising-land-registry-restricting-data","slug":"new-research-exposes-risk-privatising-land-registry-restricting-data","title":"New research exposes risks in privatising the UK Land Registry and restricting its data","format":"article","updated_at":"2017-01-03T11:03:48+00:00","created_at":"2016-04-20T08:11:59+00:00","tag_ids":["news","land-registry","data-infrastructure","economic"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/land-registry.json","web_url":null,"title":"land registry","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=land-registry","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/land-registry","slug":"land-registry"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/data-infrastructure.json","web_url":null,"title":"data infrastructure","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=data-infrastructure","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/data-infrastructure","slug":"data-infrastructure"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/economic.json","web_url":null,"title":"economic","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=economic","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/economic","slug":"economic"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>In light of new research commissioned by the ODI on the economic value of open versus closed data, Peter Wells reaffirms the benefits of making all Land Registry data open and unrestricted</p>","excerpt":"In light of new research commissioned by the ODI on the economic value of open versus closed data, Peter Wells reaffirms the benefits of making all Land Registry data open and unrestricted\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"New research exposes risks in privatising the UK Land Registry and restricting its data","url":"","content":"<p><em>In light of new research commissioned by the ODI on the economic value of open versus closed data, Peter Wells reaffirms the benefits of making all Land Registry data open and unrestricted</em></p>\n<p>Today we have released <a href=\"http://theodi.org/research-economic-value-open-paid-data\">new research</a> on the economic value created by open data compared to the value created by paid data or data released under a restricted licence. We hope the research helps people make better decisions about funding the publication and maintenance of<a href=\"http://theodi.org/what-is-open-data\"> open data</a> as part of a <a href=\"http://theodi.org/data-infrastructure\">robust and open data infrastructure</a>. </p>\n<p>We will use the research as part of our response to the UK Government’s consultation <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/land-registry-moving-operations-to-the-private-sector\">on transferring the operations of the Land Registry to the private sector</a>. We think it will help us make better decisions about the data that the Land Registry keeps and maintains both now and in the future.</p>\n<p>The Land Registry underpins the records of land and property ownership. It is vitally important to the UK’s housing sector.</p>\n<p>But the data that the Land Registry, either currently or in the future, maintains is also part of our data infrastructure, both in the UK and internationally. As a topical example, the Land Registry’s records of property and land ownership are part of a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@peterkwells/panama-open-data-personal-data-open-panama-beef6cea76fc#.44vxxkprz\">global data infrastructure for anti-corruption</a>. Land Registry data is used in multiple sectors to deliver services and find insights. It is vital to and underpins innovation, transparency, accountability, public services, and civil society.</p>\n<p>The new economic research helps us understand the risk to our economy through the proposed transfer of operations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"theresearchsaysthatopendatacreatesmorevaluethanpaidorrestricteddata\">The research says that open data creates more value than paid or restricted data</h3>\n<p>The new report says that across all core public sector data assets, some of which are maintained by the Land Registry, open data will provide 0.5% of GDP more economic value every year than data that users have to pay for. </p>\n<p>In 2014, for <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/timeseries/abmi\">the UK this increase in GDP would have amounted to £9bn</a>. Across <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/region/EUU\">the EU</a> it would be £56bn. Across <a href=\"http://www.statista.com/statistics/268750/global-gross-domestic-product-gdp/\">the world</a>? £232bn. </p>\n<h3 id=\"peopleandgovernmentsbenefit\">People and governments benefit</h3>\n<p>The report explains that most of this value is likely to be passed on by a relatively competitive production chain. Based on our research of <a href=\"http://theodi.org/open-enterprise-big-business\">open enterprises</a> we suspect that those businesses that embrace open data and open innovation will win the competition in their segment of the chain. Because of this competition the value will eventually be passed on to people</p>\n<p>Because people receive the additional value we will receive better services and a wide range of economic effects will be triggered. This will lead to extra tax revenues for governments. Putting a precise figure on these additional tax revenues is not easy and probably not possible – this is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics\">macroeconomics</a> after all – but we can estimate.</p>\n<p>One way to estimate is to assume that people tend to spend money in their home countries hence governments will receive extra revenues due to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax\">sales taxes</a>. This argument would tell us that the UK Government could have reasonably seen an additional £1.8bn/year of extra <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax\">VAT</a> (20% of the extra £9bn of value) in 2014.</p>\n<p>Another estimation method would be to look at <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/table-a-total-tax-revenue--gdp.htm\">the total tax revenue as a percentage of GDP</a>. In 2014 this would have amounted to £3bn/year for the UK (32.65% of the extra £9bn).</p>\n<p>Both of these estimates – £1.8bn/year and £3bn/year – are useful increases in the UK tax take. This revenue could support public services including the maintenance and publication of open data. </p>\n<h3 id=\"wealreadyreceivesomeofthisvaluebutitisatrisk\">We already receive some of this value, but it is at risk</h3>\n<p>Some of this data is already open so government is already seeing some of this extra tax revenue. The current openness of Land Registry data contributes to it, particularly <a href=\"http://landregistry.data.gov.uk/app/ppd\">price paid data</a> which is used by organisations such as <a href=\"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/\">Zoopla</a>, <a href=\"http://www.landinsight.io/\">Land Insight</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rentsquare.io/\">RentSquare</a>. This extra tax revenue is incremental to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/443249/Land_Registry_Annual_Report_2015_7_7_15_small.pdf\">regular surplus shown in the Land Registry’s accounts</a>. </p>\n<p>But the consultation on moving the operations of the Land Registry to the private sector leaves the door open for any future owner of the Land Registry to release additional data under restrictive licensing or paid models. The future owner might even choose to keep some data closed so that only they can use it. As the research shows us, these actions will inhibit GDP growth and reduce that tax revenue.</p>\n<p>A private owner has a legal duty to maximise profit for their shareholders. By necessity they will seek to maximise their own return. It is government's job to consider the impact on the economy as a whole.</p>\n<h3 id=\"datainfrastructureconnectsmultiplesectorsitrequiresstrategicthinking\">Data infrastructure connects multiple sectors, it requires strategic thinking</h3>\n<p>At a time when government is <a href=\"http://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/news/gds-chief-stephen-foreshew-cain-fear-change-biggest-barrier-digital-transformation\">trying to break down organisational silos</a> <a href=\"http://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/news/gds-chief-stephen-foreshew-cain-fear-change-biggest-barrier-digital-transformation\">a</a>n<a href=\"http://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/news/gds-chief-stephen-foreshew-cain-fear-change-biggest-barrier-digital-transformation\">d</a> <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/better-use-of-data-in-government\">use data better within government</a> it is strange to see it building barriers in our data infrastructure. These barriers add friction to our economy and reduce the value that could be created by data. Barriers should only be there when they are necessary – to secure personal data, for example.</p>\n<p>The argument does not just apply to current datasets but also to new ones that may become important in the future that may either be kept and maintained by the Land Registry or that may <em>depend</em> on data kept and maintained by the Land Registry. To maximise value our data infrastructure should <a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/seven-principles-to-help-us-strengthen-our-data-infrastructure\">be as open as possible, expect change to happen and able to evolve to meet changing needs.</a> </p>\n<p>Unless the UK government retains <strong>control</strong> over the data and releases as much data as possible as open data then whilst the UK government may receive a short-term boost to its coffers it risks losing the increase in GDP and innovation described by the report.</p>\n<p>Data infrastructure supports and connects multiple sectors. It requires long-term strategic funding and thinking from our governments to realise its full value. We need to change our approach to data policy and we need to change our approach to funding data infrastructure to take a more macroeconomic view.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ourresponsetothedatainfrastructureconsultation\">Our response to the data infrastructure consultation</h3>\n<p>The consultation on the Land Registry closes on 26 May 2016.</p>\n<p>We have <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ol8uw1u7EE9oGYjW0IR9OSXYmtw_Vk5jB_Likfp_rS0/edit\">published the themes that we intend to use in our </a><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ol8uw1u7EE9oGYjW0IR9OSXYmtw_Vk5jB_Likfp_rS0/edit\">response</a><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ol8uw1u7EE9oGYjW0IR9OSXYmtw_Vk5jB_Likfp_rS0/edit\"> openly</a> and are <a href=\"http://goo.gl/forms/xgAQbRFxJ0\">gathering information on how organisations use Land Registry data</a>.

It can improve efficiencies in business, reveal opportunities to improve public services and give insights into how technology and infrastructure work best for the people that use them.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://opendatamonitor.eu\">OpenDataMonitor platform</a>, an EU funded project to raise the quality of open data across Europe, launches today in alpha. The platform has been developed by the Open Data Institute and six partners across Europe. </p>\n<p>OpenDataMonitor will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>support entrepreneurs looking for reusable data with which to create new services;</li>\n<li>show open data owners what high-quality open data looks like; </li>\n<li>enable policy makers to better understand how other cities, regions and countries are adopting open data and the impact it is having; </li>\n<li>and enable researchers to gain insight into open data publishing patterns. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Through focusing on specific metrics, such as the percentage of datasets with open licenses, all datasets and supporting metadata will improve. </p>\n<p>Today’s launch comes after a year of research and development by the <a href=\"http://project.opendatamonitor.eu/\">project team</a>. OpenDataMonitor will harvest and analyse open data from sources or ‘catalogues’ across Europe. These include major national data hubs (such as <a href=\"http://data.gov.uk\">data.gov.uk</a>) as well as regional and local hubs. This data exploration tool has been created to provide a benchmark for open data resources in Europe. It will provide key insights into how the open data ecosystem is developing, and give detailed information about datasets and catalogues for entrepreneurs, investors, policy-makers and open data publishers and consumers. </p>\n<p>The data, set against specific <a href=\"http://project.opendatamonitor.eu/wp-content/uploads/deliverable/OpenDataMonitor_611988_D2.3-Best-practice-visualisation,-dashboard-and-key-figures-report.pdf\">metrics</a> will provide users with personalised dashboards and information, allowing them to compare open data catalogues at both national and local levels. \nThese metrics include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>total number of catalogues harvested</li>\n<li>total number of countries harvested</li>\n<li>percentage of datasets with open licenses</li>\n<li>percentage of datasets that are machine readable</li>\n<li>software platform used </li>\n<li>and number of unique publishers. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>To date, the project has collected data from over 70 catalogues across Europe. The platform will be continuously developed and improved throughout 2015, with further catalogues harvested and additional graphs, features and functionality made available to users. The project is due to be completed by November 2015. A timeline outlining dates for future improvements can be found on the website (link)</p>\n<p>OpenDataMonitor is co-funded by the European Commission as part of the <a href=\"http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/home_en.html\">seventh framework programme for research and technological development (FP7)</a>.

As a student, you started out with an undergraduate degree in psychology and philosophy. What inspired to you to move into artificial intelligence?</strong></p>\n<p>It was the philosophy and psychology. I was fascinated by two questions. What is the basis of human intelligence? Can we build intelligent machines? The first is a question that is central to psychology. The second is a question that was becoming more and more interesting to philosophers. In 1950, the great British scientist and mathematician Alan Turing had published an article in the philosophical journal Mind. The title of the article was <a href=\"http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/TuringArticle.html\" title=\"‘Computing machinery and intelligence’\">‘Computing machinery and intelligence’</a>. I wanted to take what I had learnt in psychology and find out whether we could understand intelligence by using computers. So, off I went to the Edinburgh University’s Department of Artificial Intelligence to begin a PhD. </p>\n<p><strong>In 2009, you were given the task of helping to transform access to public sector information. How far do you feel we have come since then towards open government data, and what are the biggest challenges?</strong></p>\n<p>On a number of measures the UK does very well in terms of the open government data it publishes – almost 20,000 datasets the last time I looked. In the UK we publish data from across all departments of national government, local government and the devolved administrations. The UK ranks number one in both of the most authoritative open data indices. So we have come a long way, but we cannot become complacent, or be lulled into a false sense of security. There is much more data to release, those in power too often succumb to pressures to sell public data when it should be made an open public resource, and there is another huge challenge when it comes to increasing data literacy.</p>\n<p><strong>What will you be talking about at the ODI Summit?</strong></p>\n<p>The difference that open data has made. The difference the ODI is making. The scale of our ambition going forward. I will discuss the very real challenges that remain. The potential of open data is huge. If we are to realise the benefits that open data offers for innovation and value creation we must be bold, brave and resolute. </p>\n<p><strong>Which other sessions are you most looking forward to, and why?</strong></p>\n<p>I'm really looking forward to all of them!</p>\n<p><strong>What direction do you see open data heading in over the next five years, and what most excites you about its future?</strong></p>\n<p>It will become the default setting in many areas – not just open government data but open research data from the science community. We will see an increasing number of companies realise the innovative potential that exists by making various of their data available as open data. What excites me is the network effect that we will see emerge as more data is made available as open data – data becomes more valuable as it is linked.</p>\n<p><strong>As more councils, cities and countries open up their data, which sector do you think stands to gain the most, and why?</strong></p>\n<p>All sectors benefit stand to benefit: health, education, transport, environment, energy, finance, insurance, the list goes on. These benefits emerge at all scales – from the very local, through to cities, regions, nations and internationally. I would predict that we will see a particular focus on smart cities, because an open data infrastructure for the public and private delivery of services makes so much sense at an urban level.    </p>\n<p><strong>This year we’re holding the first ever <a href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/awards/\" title=\"Open Data Awards\">Open Data Awards</a>. Why are these a good idea?</strong></p>\n<p>We should celebrate the remarkable achievements we have seen in the use, deployment and exploitation of open data. Whether it is the applications that have been built, the organisations that are pioneering the use of open data, or the many individuals whose leadership and ingenuity have made a difference. Let’s recognise these achievements.</p>\n<p><em>Sir Nigel Shadbolt will be giving the closing keynote speech at the <a href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/\" title=\"ODI Summit conference\">ODI Summit conference</a> at BFI Southbank, London, on Saturday, 4 November.

Also today, the company confirmed that five new startup businesses, and four new franchise nodes will join and that its membership programme has topped 350 participants, including the Co-op and Ocado.</p>\n<p>The ODI was founded by Sirs Tim Berners-Lee and Nigel Shadbolt in 2012. Its mission is to connect, equip and inspire people around the world to innovate with data.</p>\n<p>In its first three years the ODI has:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Unlocked over £40m* of value in investments</strong>, contracts, sales and efficiencies globally</li>\n<li><strong>Trained 2.79k people with open data skills</strong>, from entry level open data knowledge, to open data science, including 25 registered ODI trainers</li>\n<li><strong>Actively reached 1.69 million people worldwide</strong> in person and online through events, training and international engagements</li>\n<li><strong>Certified over 151k open datasets</strong> with an <a href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/\">Open Data Certificate</a>, recognising high quality publication of open data</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Startups</strong></p>\n<p>This year the ODI Startups have contributed £6.5m of value to the economy, through sales, investments and efficiency savings across 30 companies with 178 employees. Since 2012, ODI Startups have accumulated £10.5m in sales, investments and efficiency savings. In 2015 alone, 12 new businesses have joined the core incubation programme. And as one of seven partners to launch European startup accelerator, ODINE (Open Data Incubator for Europe), the ODI has taken its mentoring model Europe-wide, helping a further 5 companies.</p>\n<p>Today the ODI Startup programme welcomes 5 new companies:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.openlaws.com/\">openlaws</a>, which is creating a pan-European community-based legal platform using open data sources. </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.senseye.io/\">Senseye</a> which works with companies of all sizes to strengthen operational reliability and reduce maintenance costs for IoT connected equipment. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imin.co/\">imin</a> which uses open data to make fitness activities searchable and better connected, helping communities become more active. </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.landinsight.io\">LandInsight</a> who provide the foundations for property developers to discover and build on off-market land in the UK. </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amiq.us/\">Amiqus</a> is an online service that facilitates &amp; resolves commercial disputes quickly and affordably without appearing in court or tribunal.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Nishal Desai, co-founder at new ODI Startup, imin said: </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“With the ODI’s network, resources and knowledge base, there’s nowhere else in the world better suited to help us accelerate towards our goal.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Nodes</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://theodi.org/nodes\" title=\"ODI Node\">ODI Node</a> franchise operates in 20 countries across six continents. Four new Nodes have today joined the programme in Madrid, Birmingham, Aberdeen and Brazil bringing the total number of Nodes to 27. The new Nodes will build on the successes of the existing network which in 2015 has turned over £265k, trained more than 230 people and reached 14.5k people through training, events and collaboration. </p>\n<p>Ian Watt, Trustee of CodeTheCity, leading the new ODI Aberdeen node said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"ODI Aberdeen will build on the work of Code The City in Aberdeen and across Scotland to develop the Open Data ecosystem north of the border. This is an exciting time for Scotland with all seven cities and the Scottish Government committing to support the open data community.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Members</strong></p>\n<p>The ODI also confirmed today that its membership has topped more than 360 individuals and organisations with a shared interest in open data. Recent additions to the network include Ocado, The Co-operative Group, Esri, NHS England, SAP, Oxford University Press, University College London and Surrey County Council.</p>\n<p>Gavin Starks, CEO at the Open Data Institute said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“With over three billion people and over five billion machines connected to the internet, we are still only scratching the surface of open innovation. From finance to pharma, agriculture to the built environment, we are seeing organisations understand that the value of their data increases the more it is connected, and that open is the fastest, cheapest route to increasing that connectedness. Together, we are demonstrating that open data reduces friction in our digital economy and improves business, our society and our environment. We are extremely grateful for the support of our network members, supporters and funders, who are helping to co-create the web of data for everyone.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>*£40m figure: total amount of cash unlocked in direct investments in ODI competition funding, direct contracts and partnerships, income that ODI Nodes and ODI Startups have generated since joining the ODI programme plus ODI’s direct sales (total sales since ODI began). <a href=\"http://dashboards.theodi.org/company/all\">Source</a></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Patrice John-Baptiste","slug":"patrice-johnbaptiste","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/patrice-johnbaptiste","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme","team-member"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/about-us.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/about-us","slug":"about-us","title":"About the ODI","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-12-13T14:10:00+00:00","created_at":"2013-10-22T22:44:14+00:00","tag_ids":["page","open-data-institute"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/join-us.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/join-us","slug":"join-us","title":"ODI Membership","format":"article","updated_at":"2017-05-03T13:45:00+00:00","created_at":"2013-03-04T08:47:46+00:00","tag_ids":["page","members","membership"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/start-ups.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/start-ups","slug":"start-ups","title":"Startups","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-07-12T15:36:35+00:00","created_at":"2013-11-19T17:08:42+00:00","tag_ids":["page","startup","mentoring"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/about-nodes.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/about-nodes","slug":"about-nodes","title":"ODI Nodes","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-07-06T08:45:31+00:00","created_at":"2013-10-23T11:22:16+00:00","tag_ids":["page","node","nodes","international"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Patrice John-Baptiste","slug":"patrice-johnbaptiste","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/patrice-johnbaptiste","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme","team-member"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-41m-omidyar-network-catalyse-open-data-culture.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-41m-omidyar-network-catalyse-open-data-culture","slug":"odi-41m-omidyar-network-catalyse-open-data-culture","title":"Open Data Institute receives $4.1M from Omidyar Network to catalyse open data culture","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:58:58+00:00","created_at":"2015-02-18T17:33:56+00:00","tag_ids":["news","funding"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/funding.json","web_url":null,"title":"funding","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=funding","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/funding","slug":"funding"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>Second annual report celebrates hitting reach, influence and impact targets</p>","excerpt":"[Second annual report](http://theodi.org/odis-second-year-annual-report) celebrates hitting reach, influence and impact targets\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"","url":"","content":"<p><em><a href=\"http://theodi.org/odis-second-year-annual-report\">Second annual report</a> celebrates hitting reach, influence and impact targets</em></p>\n<p>The ODI has announced that it has been awarded a grant of $4.1m from <a href=\"https://www.omidyar.com/\" title=\"Omidyar Network\">Omidyar Network</a>, aimed at creating value from open data across the world.</p>\n<p>Supported by the new grant, the ODI will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expand its Global Network to include thousands of individuals and organisations who are pioneers in the open data economy.</li>\n<li>Grow capabilities by creating accredited trainers and training thousands of individuals in the theory and practice of open data.</li>\n<li>Expand its Innovation Unit to build services, tools (e.g. <a href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/\" title=\"Open Data Certificates\">Open Data Certificates</a>), provide policy guidance, and enhance the evidence base of open data impact.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Two years of success</strong></p>\n<p>Today’s announcement comes as the ODI publishes its <a href=\"http://theodi.org/odis-second-year-annual-report\">second annual report</a> showing growth across all areas of the business.

With their help, we are demonstrating that open data is broad and deep in its influence. Businesses are seeing open data as a competitive advantage, governments are revealing insights and efficiencies, and startups are paving the way in the data-innovation landscape across all sectors. Open data will help inform policy, impact your daily decisions, shape design and affect our built environment. We must increase outreach in both data literacy and demonstrate the impact of open data and we must support organisations in their journeys from closed to shared, and from shared to open.”</p>\n</blockquote>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odis-second-year-annual-report.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odis-second-year-annual-report","slug":"odis-second-year-annual-report","title":"ODI's 2nd Year: Annual Report","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:59:16+00:00","created_at":"2015-02-18T11:07:28+00:00","tag_ids":["page","annual-report"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odis-first-year-annual-report.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odis-first-year-annual-report","slug":"odis-first-year-annual-report","title":"ODI's First Year: Annual Report","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:52:46+00:00","created_at":"2013-11-01T12:11:27+00:00","tag_ids":["page"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-accelerates-government-open-data-expertise-with-new-funding.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-accelerates-government-open-data-expertise-with-new-funding","slug":"odi-accelerates-government-open-data-expertise-with-new-funding","title":"ODI accelerates government open data expertise with new funding ","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:54:47+00:00","created_at":"2014-02-21T14:30:28+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>The Open Data Institute has been named one of the first recipients of a government ‘Release of Data Fund’ aimed at accelerating the adoption of open data practices across the Civil Service.</p>","excerpt":"The Open Data Institute has been named one of the first recipients of a government ‘Release of Data Fund’ aimed at accelerating the adoption of open data practices across the Civil Service.\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"ODI accelerates government open data expertise with new funding ","url":"","content":"<p>The Open Data Institute has been named one of the first recipients of a government ‘Release of Data Fund’ aimed at accelerating the adoption of open data practices across the Civil Service.</p>\n<p>Announced ahead of tomorrow’s International <a href=\"http://opendataday.org/\">Open Data Day</a>, the award of £150k will be used to train dozens of Whitehall staff to use and understand open data.

Both clear conditions and certification will allow people from diverse sectors and backgrounds to feel more confident in reusing data meaning ODCs will play an important and valuable role in the ODI’s and DataCite’s ongoing work. </p>\n<p><em>Jeni Tennison, Technical Director at ODI says:</em> </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Enabling data reusers to cite the data that they have reused is an essential part of building an open data ecosystem, particularly to ensure that data creators and publishers get recognised for their work. I’m delighted that we will be working with DataCite to incorporate data citation into standard practice, including outside the research community, and to look at how data quality measures, particularly the Open Data Certificates, can be associated with and discoverable from data identifiers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Over the next two years, the organisations will work together to understand and address the issues around linking identifiers to certificates, and make them available through identifier resolution services as well as metadata services. They will also encourage open data providers to use persistent, resolvable identifiers and adopt Open Data Certificate and link them to identifiers. </p>\n<p>Additionally, the partnership will encourage the establishment of services that benefit from clear information about the conditions under which data can be reused.  </p>\n<p><em>Adam Farquhar, President of DataCite says:</em> </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sharing and reusing open research data is becoming ever more important for science, research, and commerce. In our pursuit to offer reliable and persistent data identification services, we are committed to supporting hundreds of data centres worldwide assigning millions of identifiers. Together with the ODI, we will be able to enhance the recognition of open data, enable data providers to more easily adopt ODCs, and enable researchers to confidently understand which data are open for reuse.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><em>For more information, contact:</em></p>\n<p><strong>ODI Communications Team</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Phone: +44 7 825 988805</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Email: <a href=\"mailto:comms@theodi.org\">comms@theodi.org</a></strong></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-and-mztek-shortlisted-for-35th-arts-business-awards.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-and-mztek-shortlisted-for-35th-arts-business-awards","slug":"odi-and-mztek-shortlisted-for-35th-arts-business-awards","title":"ODI and MzTEK shortlisted for 35th Arts & Business Awards ","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:55:12+00:00","created_at":"2014-04-06T19:15:30+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>The partnership between the (ODI) and MzTEK has today (7th April) been shortlisted for this year’s Arts &amp; Business (A&amp;B) Awards which celebrate the finest partnerships between the commercial and cultural sectors.

This year, more than 90 partnerships entered across the 8 award categories.</p>\n<p>The partnership has been recognised as one of the top five within the A&amp;B New Sponsorship Award category for the innovative use of the arts to reinforce the branding and marketing activity of the business. It demonstrates how new collaborations between the arts and business sectors continue to drive exciting arts initiatives throughout the UK.</p>\n<p>In 2012, as a brand new organisation with no prior engagement with the arts, the ODI sponsored the female-focused organisation MzTEK to become a partner in the <a href=\"http://theodi.org/culture\">Data as Culture</a> programme. MzTEK not only had access to artists working in the field of new media, computer arts and technology but could also ensure a balanced demographic was reached in the commissioning process. </p>\n<p><strong>Sophie McDonald</strong>, MzTEK and co-curator of the first Data as Culture exhibition, said:</p>\n<p>“Being a partner in the Data as Culture programme was an exciting opportunity for MzTEK to expand our curatorial practice, reach new audiences and support female data artists to apply for the data-driven art commissions, an area which is predominantly a male domain.”</p>\n<p><strong>Julie Freeman</strong>, Open Data Institute Art Associate and co-curator of Data as Culture said:</p>\n<p>“The impact of the Data as Culture art programme has been significant not only to the ODI community but in the wider context of the arts. Our programme is becoming a key player in the creation and promotion of data art.”</p>\n<p><strong>Gavin Starks</strong>, Open Data Institute CEO said:</p>\n<p>“Data as Culture is for everyone. We want to ensure conversations about open data expand beyond specialist communities and through to the general public. Using data as a material increases awareness of what data is, how it can be used creatively, how it can inspire, encourage play and lateral thinking, and help people share stories and experiences. It has touched everyone who has visited the ODI, our team, and reached an international audience via global media channels.”</p>\n<p>As Chair of the New Sponsorship judging panel and Head of Marketing at Barclays, <strong>Jane Powell</strong> states of the shortlisted partnerships: “I think a number of them can actually form a model for how businesses and arts organisations can work really well together and in very imaginative ways as well.”</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-and-sport-england-join-forces-to-get-us-all-more-active-with-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-and-sport-england-join-forces-to-get-us-all-more-active-with-data","slug":"odi-and-sport-england-join-forces-to-get-us-all-more-active-with-data","title":"The ODI and Sport England join forces to get us all more active with data","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-12-09T17:48:26+00:00","created_at":"2016-10-31T17:44:21+00:00","tag_ids":["news","sport","sport-england","fitness"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/sport.json","web_url":null,"title":"sport","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=sport","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/sport","slug":"sport"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/sport-england.json","web_url":null,"title":"Sport England","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=sport-england","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/sport-england","slug":"sport-england"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/fitness.json","web_url":null,"title":"fitness","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=fitness","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/fitness","slug":"fitness"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>The Open Data Institute and Sport England are announcing a new collaboration at the <a href=\"http://theodi.org/summit/2016\">ODI Summit</a> in London today.

This data, which won’t include any personal information, will be open for anyone to access, use and share.</p>\n<p>Providers will be helped to publish their data in a consistent format that’s easy to create and use, thanks to a new set of standards being co-developed with the sector. </p>\n<p>At any one time, around <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/get-inspired/36328670\">28% of people in England are inactive</a>. They face many emotional and practical barriers – one being a lack of information on what's available to them. The new collaboration will address this and encourage the development of new physical activity products and services, including apps, by unlocking the ‘fuel’ that powers them: high-quality, comprehensive data on where and when there are opportunities to be active.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeni Tennison, CEO at the ODI, said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We all use apps and digital services to make the most of our downtime: to find a good local restaurant, book cinema tickets, or research our next holiday. But it can be far more difficult to identify ways of getting more active. One reason is a lack of data to power online services, like those we’ve come to expect for other activities. </p>\n  <p>Over the coming months the ODI, Sport England and the physical activity community will come together to create new ways to find activities – engaging large and small organisations to publish their data for the first time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"enablingnewsportproductsandservices\">Enabling new sport products and services</h3>\n<p>Innovators, developers and startups will be encouraged to develop products and services to get people active, using physical activity data. Open data will make it easier to build solutions that target people who do little or no physical activity and could benefit most from better services.</p>\n<p>Many who hold physical activity data like the idea of making it open but lack the tools and guidance to do so. Enhancing data literacy in the sector is therefore a priority, and the ODI will help to make publishing physical activity data as easy as possible for providers. </p>\n<p>Today’s announcement marks the beginning of a longer-term cultural change for the physical activity sector in how it uses data to keep pace with the digital expectations of customers, supporting them to find relevant and high-quality information on their smartphones. This in turn helps providers market their services more effectively and grow their customer base. The work will build on existing best practice and harness the momentum created by grassroots data movements in the sport sector. </p>\n<p><strong>Lisa O’Keefe, Director of Insight at Sport England, who will announce the collaboration today, said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With opportunities to go swimming described and advertised in more than 6,000 different ways, you can be left feeling it's easier to break the enigma code than navigate a pool timetable. But it doesn't have to be that way and the sports sector is ready and willing to change that. </p>\n  <p>We want to make it as easy to book a badminton court as it is a hotel room, and open data is an essential part of that. We're thrilled to be joining forces with the ODI to turn our ambition for convenient, immediate and accessible information about local sporting opportunities into a reality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>If you’d like to get more involved in the work of this new collaboration, <a href=\"https://www.openactive.io/join.html\">please enter your details here</a>.</strong></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-summit-and-awards-2016.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/events/odi-summit-and-awards-2016","slug":"odi-summit-and-awards-2016","title":"ODI Summit and Awards 2016","format":"event","updated_at":"2016-11-01T13:38:34+00:00","created_at":"2016-06-01T14:33:12+00:00","tag_ids":["event:panel-discussions","odi-summit","odi-awards"],"extras":{"start_date":"2016-11-01T09:00:00+00:00","end_date":"2016-11-01T20:00:00+00:00","location":"BFI Southbank"}}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-and-taiwans-open-data-alliance-sign-up-to-open-data-collaboration.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-and-taiwans-open-data-alliance-sign-up-to-open-data-collaboration","slug":"odi-and-taiwans-open-data-alliance-sign-up-to-open-data-collaboration","title":"ODI and Taiwan's Open Data Alliance sign up to open data collaboration","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:53:32+00:00","created_at":"2013-12-11T17:51:42+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"","url":"","content":"<p>The UK’s Open Data Institute (ODI) and Taiwan’s Open Data Alliance (ODA) signed a Letter of Intent on 11 December 2013, which will see the two organisations promote and explore the potential open data holds for the public, private and academic sectors in both countries.

The ODI will be mapping the use of open data across the UK business community. This study will identify how companies organise their business around open data to create innovative products and services, and unveil the impact of open data to the UK economy.</p>\n<p>The survey has been developed in partnership with The GovLab’s <a href=\"http://www.opendata500.com/\">Open Data 500</a>, a related US study that has proved to be a valuable indicator of how American companies are using open government data. The ODI’s study will have broader scope, including examining the use of open data from commercial organisations and community projects. The collaboration with the team behind the US study will enable across-the-pond comparisons of the development of commercial open data markets.</p>\n<p>The ODI has already made contact with hundreds of businesses, and will be communicating with hundreds more over the coming months. Today the ODI would like to invite any UK company working with open data to participate in the survey. </p>\n<p>Specific areas of investigation include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How open data is used to create products and services and how these generate revenue</li>\n<li>Which open datasets are used from government and industry</li>\n<li>The challenges for businesses in using open data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Analysis of businesses included in the study so far shows:</p>\n<p><strong>Open data is creating business impact</strong>: Of 700 organisations scoped for inclusion, including over 100 ODI members, 320 companies from across 16 different industry sectors are publishing or using open data to develop innovative products and services.</p>\n<p><strong>Open data impacts all sectors</strong>: two thirds (67%) of identified companies operate outside of the data and technology sectors, in industries such as energy, education, healthcare and insurance.</p>\n<p><strong>Open data is a nationwide phenomenon</strong>: Over 60% of companies responding to the survey are based outside London, including Derry, Aberystwyth, Livingston, Blackpool and the Isle of Man. </p>\n<p><strong>Companies of all sizes are working with open data</strong>: 70% of companies responding to the survey are small businesses and startups developing open data driven solutions with the potential to disrupt their host industries. More established companies are also exploring the potential of open data for open innovation.</p>\n<p>The findings of the study, to be revealed in Spring 2015, will identify innovative British open data businesses and draw together key insights on the UK’s open data landscape. They will also inform government digital policy by identifying how open data is bringing value to UK businesses, as well as the challenges faced by companies working with open data. </p>\n<p><strong>Tom Heath, Head of Research at the ODI said:</strong>\n“At the ODI we are constantly seeking evidence of the impact open data is making across the UK, and the world. This study is a big step forward in systematically tracking open data adoption across UK industry. The combination of survey responses and desk research will provide a robust basis for detailed insights into the UK commercial open data landscape.”</p>\n<p><strong>Gavin Starks, CEO at the ODI said:</strong>\n“Part of our role at the ODI is to showcase the huge amount of innovation that is already being unlocked using open data.

If the Government is serious about making data open, it has to be made available and fast.”</p>\n<p><strong>Executive order</strong></p>\n<p>Last week, the White House issued an\u0002<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-13.pdf\">executive order</a>\u0002requiring all US federal government data to be open and machine-readable. \u0002Whilst the ODI supports the recommendations in today’s report, both CEO, Starks and Chairman, Nigel Shadbolt, do not want the UK falling behind the US. They would have liked to see bolder statements of intent around two important areas: aiding innovation and ensuring data sets are published.</p>\n<p>Gavin Starks says: “Whilst the report provides a solid set of recommendations, the ODI would like to have seen a greater emphasis placed on the role\u0002that public sector information can play in innovation. When it comes to open data, the UK has the leadership position, so why aren't\u0002we being more ambitious?”</p>\n<p>He continues, “The role of the ODI is to turn ambition into innovation and help new start-ups to thrive. But here we are, at the brink of something that will enable us to bring about a revolution - a web of data on a par with the existing web - and we are backing away and being cautious when we could be bold. The Government is a key customer for innovation and its leadership cannot be underestimated.”</p>\n<p><strong>ODI role</strong></p>\n<p>The valuable role of the ODI in driving innovation forward is highlighted in today’s report: “As an example of innovation, we have the Open Data Institute. Co-funded by government and business, the ODI is well-placed to demonstrate the value latent in Public Sector Information (PSI), for example through building the demand side for PSI (including public sector use of its own data and incubating start-ups), and training business to best exploit and innovate with the data released by government.”</p>\n<p>Forming part of the recommendations by Shakespeare is the establishment of and access to, National Core Reference Data (the most important data held by each government department and other publicly funded bodies).</p>\n<p>Nigel Shadbolt, the ODI’s Chairman comments: “We are pleased that the report highlights the importance of a national core data function. But what needs to happen now is to identify core data sets and ensure they are published – that calls for clear leadership from the Government.”</p>\n<p>“As with the recent executive order in the US, the ODI would like to see a legal duty placed on public bodies to create and maintain the core reference data. To strengthen trust in the on-going availability and consistency of this data, this legal duty should be supplemented by a power in legislation for a Secretary of State to designate uniform resource identifiers (URIs) for this core reference data. This way we can provide universal and linked access to the core data on which future business and government will depend.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shakespeare-review-of-public-sector-information\">Read the full Shakespeare Report</a></p>\n<p>Read about the ODI's\u0002<a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/consultation-response/independent-public-sector-information-review\">Open Data Market Makers</a>\u0002event, convened in March to inform the Shakespeare report</p>","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-celebrates-first-birthday-announcing-university-southampton-honorary-partner.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-celebrates-first-birthday-announcing-university-southampton-honorary-partner","slug":"odi-celebrates-first-birthday-announcing-university-southampton-honorary-partner","title":"ODI celebrates first birthday by announcing University of Southampton as Honorary Partner ","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:52:32+00:00","created_at":"2013-10-01T07:12:05+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}}],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>The\u0002 University of Southampton has been awarded Honorary Founding Partner status in recognition of its exceptional contribution to the setup and development of the ODI.

Today’s launch at Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall is supported by artists including David Hockney, Marina Abramovic and Ai Weiwei. The Space is jointly funded by the BBC and the Arts Council.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><strong>ODI President and co-founder, Sir Tim Berners-Lee said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Artists wake us up to all that happens in the world. The Space and the ODI can make that happen on the web.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>‘We Need Us’ is a live online animated artwork that explores big data. The work concentrates on metadata which it draws from the activities of Zooniverse’s million+ participants, to create an environment of sounds and animated forms. Unlike traditional data-visualisation which helps people understand and make sense of information held in large data sets, ‘We Need Us’ investigates the unique properties of the data itself. </p>\n<p><strong>Artist, Julie Freeman said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Imagine a web where we stumble and fall into art as we do in real-life. The Space is a starting point for this to happen, bringing works like ‘We Need Us’ to everyone; I’m delighted to be one of the first co-commissioned artists. Working in residence at the Open Data Institute has enabled me to work with data in a deep way, interrogating it as an art material, looking for the growth, momentum and fragility within it. The work I’m creating requires data from online activities of people to come alive. The idea is to remind people of the humanity in technology - that we need ‘us’ as much as we need it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>ODI CEO, Gavin Starks said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Using open data as a creative material helps us understand how it touches all our lives: our own data, or data about us, about our society, our financial system, our health, our environment -- all have impacts that affect us every day, personally, locally and globally. ‘We Need Us’ is literal in its reflection of this: the work is built on millions of interactions from over a million people, working together to solve massive-scale problems. We are delighted that The Space is partnering to co-commission with ODI, and building on our <a href=\"http://theodi.org/culture\">Data as Culture</a> programme - which views data as part of our cultural landscape.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ruth Mackenzie, Launch Director of The Space said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Space will commission around 50 new works a year from great artists, both known and unknown, and share them freely with audiences from around the World. We are delighted that the ODI is involved in the programme. ‘We Need Us’ promises to be a dynamic and imaginative work. It’s very much in the spirit of The Space which will generate new art and maybe new art forms - what an amazing opportunity for all of us to try to see into the future.</p>\n</blockquote>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/culture.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/culture","slug":"culture","title":"Data as Culture","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-08-19T11:02:10+00:00","created_at":"2012-11-25T22:02:06+00:00","tag_ids":["page","data-as-culture","culture","art","data-driven"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/friday-lunchtime-lecture-data-as-culture-2014.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures/friday-lunchtime-lecture-data-as-culture-2014","slug":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-data-as-culture-2014","title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: Data as Culture 2014","format":"event","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:55:22+00:00","created_at":"2014-04-01T16:58:04+00:00","tag_ids":["featured","event:lunchtime-lecture"],"extras":{"start_date":"2014-04-11T12:00:00+00:00","end_date":"2014-04-11T12:50:00+00:00","location":"Open Data Institute, 65 Clifton Street, London, EC2A 4JE"}}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-cooks-up-new-focus-on-agriculture-and-nutrition.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-cooks-up-new-focus-on-agriculture-and-nutrition","slug":"odi-cooks-up-new-focus-on-agriculture-and-nutrition","title":"ODI cooks up new focus on agriculture and nutrition","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:03:31+00:00","created_at":"2015-08-27T08:37:43+00:00","tag_ids":["news","agriculture-and-nutrition"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/agriculture-and-nutrition.json","web_url":null,"title":"agriculture and nutrition","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=agriculture-and-nutrition","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/agriculture-and-nutrition","slug":"agriculture-and-nutrition"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>With over 7 billion mouths to feed and a food retail industry worth $4 trillion a year, we are exploring how open data can make our global food system more efficient, from farm to fork</p>","excerpt":"With over 7 billion mouths to feed and a food retail industry worth $4 trillion a year, we are exploring how open data can make our global food system more efficient, from farm to fork\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"","url":"","content":"<p><em>With over 7 billion mouths to feed and a food retail industry worth $4 trillion a year, we are exploring how open data can make our global food system more efficient, from farm to fork</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/de/de/55dede08f362be01ec000024/15565453556_350e9a3334_z.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img text-center\" id=\"55dede07f362be7e2f00001e\"> \n<small>Up-to-date information and insights are key to how we farm and feed the world, from weather to market prices. <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" title=\"CC BY 2.0\">CC BY 2.0</a>, uploaded by [Mr. Nixter](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stankus/15565453556/in/photolist-pHt23U-7bLQvf-7Ffi82-8Bpo47-fYNwJj-p8N3Ga-fK9Rb9-gXJgyg-p9kH2w-mp7CD-q8f3z-5hUm67-cRFfEL-fALYRv-5qxp7P-6uSZnC-8NkPRT-8C6SqK-wzEHjC-eWfGEk-aUPVhx-hw4bmm-fB2hD3-gNae7k-qgTYA3-fgUGPj-mVjCo-7a5i6Z-5mS5mJ-aAii2f-58wDQ3-5CEGo-4k1oZL-8zammV-nc9Nz-8DgFcr-ruyF5h-cvK2cQ-fFCZSs-dc9w7D-4edgH7-orLMmp-d49hZw-azFrcX-5upDja-dbwU2K-64J2mY-ffATie-8x3FKi-78s6yY “Mr. Nixter\").</small></p>\n<p>One reason why working in open data is so exciting is that it can bring benefits to arguably every industry and sector. At the ODI we see the social, economic and environmental benefits open data can bring in many different contexts, through the work of our global network: members, nodes and startups, along with our own programmes of work.</p>\n<p>There are a few areas we focus on in particular, where we know that with dedicated research, collaboration and coverage, we can help fulfil open data’s potential to bring about positive change. In addition to open cities and data infrastructure, one of our new sector themes is <a href=\"http://theodi.org/agriculture-nutrition-open-data\" title=\"ODI - agriculture and nutrition\">agriculture and nutrition</a>. </p>\n<p>The global food system is vast and complex. With over <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-15459643\" title=\"BBC - population seven million\">seven billion</a> mouths to feed and a food retail industry worth about <a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/global-food-industry-000000272.html\" title=\"Yahoo finance - global food industry\">$4 trillion</a> a year, we depend as much on agriculture for our sustenance as for our economic stability. But with the combined pressures of a growing population, climate uncertainty and volatile market forces, the system is struggling. An <a href=\"http://reports.thomsonreuters.com/9billionbowls/\" title=\"Thomson reuters - how will we fill 9 million bowls by 2050?\">estimated 805 million</a> people go to bed hungry each night, and hidden hunger – or micronutrient deficiency – affects an additional 2 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.</p>\n<h3 id=\"opendatafuellingagriculturalintelligence\">Open data: fuelling agricultural intelligence###</h3>\n<p>Up-to-date information and insights are key to how we farm and feed the world. We believe the only way we can future-proof our global food system is by ensuring that those who produce, trade and buy food are well-informed at each step of the value chain. </p>\n<p>Farmers need access to a lot of information – ranging from weather patterns and farming techniques to crop or animal diseases – in order to get the best yields. A growing number of initiatives are being set up to help farmers collect and access data to help promote best practice in the face of unpredictable climates and limited resources.</p>\n<p>In many countries, the public sector – often in close collaboration with research institutes – takes a leading role in promoting precision-farming through the release of geospatial data, for example satellite imagery. Government-led initiatives include the United States Department of Agriculture’s <a href=\"http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/\" title=\"National agricultural library\">nutrient database</a>, California state’s <a href=\"http://cida.usgs.gov/ca_drought/\" title=\"USGS - California drought, visualised with open data\">water resource in drought</a> tracking, and the Netherlands’ <a href=\"http://www.groenmonitor.nl/\" title=\"Groenmonitor - latest news\">GroenMonitor.nl</a> project, which exposes and predicts outbreaks of pest infestation or disease on crops.</p>\n<p>Similar initiatives also exist within the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/improving-nutrition\" title=\"Guardian - improving nutrition and food security\">aid and development sectors</a> as well as the private sector, as businesses are seeing the potential that data can bring to the agricultural industry. A good example is <a href=\"http://www.awhere.com/\" title=\"AWhere - home\">AWhere</a>, a software company that provides agri-weather analytics to farmers around the world, from California’s Central Valley to smallholder farms in Ghana, via apps and SMS messaging. </p>\n<p>AWhere sums up this initiative (and those like it) well in defining the ultimate goal as being to bring about an era of “<a href=\"http://www.awhere.com/about\" title=\"AWhere - about\">agricultural intelligence</a>”, helping farmers base their decision making not on “best guesses” but from “accessible quantitative data; reducing risk and ambiguity and increasing profit.\"</p>\n<p>Once food has been farmed, those handling it must avoid post-harvest losses brought about by <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/ac301e/ac301e03.htm\" title=\"fao.org\">unsuitable storage or transport conditions</a>, or <a href=\"http://news.ilri.org/2014/05/06/aflatoxins-in-kens-food-chain/\" title=\"Ilri news - Aflatoxins in Kenya's food chain\">aflatoxins</a> and other diseases spread accidentally by contaminated farming equipment. Up-to-date data shared across accessible formats will be crucial in helping farmers around the world overcome these challenges and ensure food safety. <a href=\"https://www.plantwise.org/\" title=\"Plantwise.org\">Plantwise</a> helps smallholder farmers deal with plant health issues, combining global and local open access data to provide a <a href=\"http://www.plantwise.org/KnowledgeBank/home.aspx\" title=\"plantwise - knowledge bank\">knowledge bank</a> used by over 600,000 farmers in 33 countries. Plantwise won the <a href=\"https://www.plantwise.org/news-and-media/odi-award-for-plantwise/\" title=\"plantwise - taking home the social impact prize\">Open Data Award for Social Impact</a> at the ODI Awards, 2014. </p>\n<h3 id=\"improvingaccesstomarketsandtradingefficiency\">Improving access to markets and trading efficiency</h3>\n<p>Food mostly reaches consumers via markets and trade, contributing to economies and providing a living for those in the industry. Whether small-scale merchants in developing countries or industrial traders across borders, they all need information about markets and prices to trade and make a profit. </p>\n<p>There is huge potential for open agriculture data to be analysed, visualised and combined with geographic information systems to help inform farmers, food traders and aid groups alike to buy, sell and target areas in need. The G20-driven <a href=\"http://www.amis-outlook.org/\" title=\"Amis\">Agriculture Market Information System</a> uses open data to monitor and analyse key markets for wheat, maize, rice and soybeans. Its information helped inform responses and decisions during the 2012 drought. Earlier this year, the International Food Policy Research Institute <a href=\"http://www.ifpri.org/news-release/new-web-portal-provides-open-data-food-and-nutrition-security-africa\" title=\"IFPRI - new web portal provides open data on food and nutrition security in Africa\">set up</a> a web portal hosting open data and blogs on food and nutrition security, early warning mechanisms and markets in Africa south of the Sahara. Through open information-sharing and dialogue, it aims to boost the resilience of the region’s poor to possible food-related crises, including price and climate shocks. Meanwhile, a range of custom-designed mobile app services built upon some of this data (like <a href=\"http://mfarm.co.ke/\" title=\"Mfarm\">MFarm</a> in Kenya) deliver localised market information directly to farmers via mobile technology to help them decide when to sell, which markets to target, while promoting pricing transparency. </p>\n<p>With more open data initiatives like these, and ‘infomediaries’ to help ensure that data is translated into accessible information, even those without computer literacy or internet access can benefit from open data in the agriculture and nutrition sector.</p>\n<h3 id=\"empoweringconsumerstomakebetterinformedchoices\">Empowering consumers to make better-informed choices</h3>\n<p>At the other end of the value chain, consumers want to know the risks and nutritional value of the food they eat, and where their food comes from. When data about food nutrients is made open, it can help people make better decisions about the food they eat according to their needs. The <a href=\"http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/\">USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference</a> provides open nutrient data for more than 8,500 food items, informing individuals, health professionals, nutrition educators and the food industry to help consumers build healthier diets. In the UK, <a href=\"https://theodi.org/opendatachallengeseries\" title=\"theodi - open data challenge series\">Open Data Challenge Series</a> winner <a href=\"http://foodtrade.menu/#!/\" title=\"foodtrade- menu\">FoodTrade</a>, offers a service to food vendors helping them manage the allergen and dietary content of their menus, and uses this as a starting point to link them to relevant local food producers. It uses a combination of Food Standards Agency data with user input, and also commits to publishing their own open data as well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howwilltheodihelpimproveagricultureandnutritionwithopendata\">How will the ODI help improve agriculture and nutrition with open data?###</h3>\n<p>The examples outlined here highlight some of the first successful applications of open data for agriculture and nutrition. We believe that with the right research, engagement and buy-in from those in the industry, we can help encourage many more.</p>\n<p>Through <strong>applied research, open discussion and sector-focused events</strong>, we are exploring what works, what the challenges are and what our global priorities should be.

The ODI is a collaboration between leading businesses and entrepreneurs, universities and researchers, government and civil society to unlock enterprise and social value from the vast amount of Open Data now being made accessible. As a collaborative, dynamic space which will host a diverse range of innovators, we are aiming for the commissioned artwork to give visual momentum to the environment, by bringing the space alive and inspiring new perspectives on Open Data. As an equal opportunity organisation The ODI welcomes applications from all artists, irrespective of ethnic origin, gender, marital status, sexuality, age or disability. Our offices are accessible. Please help us monitor the diversity of artists working in this area by completing our equality questionnaire with your submission. The ODI has engaged <a href=\"http://www.mztek.org\">MzTEK</a> to manage this exciting commissioning process. MzTEK is a non-profit organisation with the aim of addressing the imbalance of women artists working in the fields of new media, computer arts, and technology. Please email <a href=\"mailto:commissions@mztek.org\">commissions@mztek.org</a> if you have any questions. We appreciate that the timescales for this project is extremely tight and will endeavour to respond swiftly. The ODI reserves the right to commission work directly should the number or quality of entries be insufficient.</p>","organizations":[],"author":{}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-future-cities-catapult-joint-vision-efficient-safe-cities-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-future-cities-catapult-joint-vision-efficient-safe-cities-open-data","slug":"odi-future-cities-catapult-joint-vision-efficient-safe-cities-open-data","title":"ODI and Future Cities Catapult share joint vision for efficient, safe, data-driven cities","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-25T15:13:05+00:00","created_at":"2015-09-24T15:46:35+00:00","tag_ids":["news","future-cities-catapult","open-cities","smart-cities"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/future-cities-catapult.json","web_url":null,"title":"Future Cities Catapult","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=future-cities-catapult","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/future-cities-catapult","slug":"future-cities-catapult"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/open-cities.json","web_url":null,"title":"open cities","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=open-cities","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/open-cities","slug":"open-cities"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/smart-cities.json","web_url":null,"title":"Smart cities","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=smart-cities","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/smart-cities","slug":"smart-cities"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>How can data help improve the way we use cities?

The company estimated that a delay of 53 days, caused by a tendering process that is 45% slower than the EU averages, delays £734m of cash flow to UK SMEs each year.

The organisation is currently developing <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/public-procurement/blob/master/guide.md\">a guide</a> for public sector organisations to build open data into the delivery of public services through the procurement process. Over the next year, ODI will be training over 120 procurement officers in government about how to embed transparency about performance and costs into contracts.</p>\n<p>The ODI’s Technical Director, Jeni Tennison said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Embedding transparency and open data into contracts requires a change of attitude, culture and mindset. We are providing concrete, practical help for procurement officers and contract managers, through the guides and training that we are putting together, to deploy open data to enhance transparency, improve efficiency and drive innovation. We are working with a number of private sector companies who are already seeing the benefits of opening up data. We would like to see more organisations, including those supplying services to government, being proactive and becoming open by default.</p>\n</blockquote>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/new-startups-announced-reducing-government-energy-costs-and-shining-light-public-sector.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/new-startups-announced-reducing-government-energy-costs-and-shining-light-public-sector","slug":"new-startups-announced-reducing-government-energy-costs-and-shining-light-public-sector","title":"New startups announced - reducing Government energy costs and shining light on public sector spending ","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:51:45+00:00","created_at":"2013-08-28T06:29:18+00:00","tag_ids":["news"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-helps-unlock-11m-for-open-data-innovation-in-europe.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-helps-unlock-11m-for-open-data-innovation-in-europe","slug":"odi-helps-unlock-11m-for-open-data-innovation-in-europe","title":"ODI helps unlock £11m for open data innovation in Europe","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:57:39+00:00","created_at":"2014-11-04T10:37:31+00:00","tag_ids":["news","press-release","odine","europe","startups"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/press-release.json","web_url":null,"title":"press release","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=press-release","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/press-release","slug":"press-release"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/odine.json","web_url":null,"title":"odine","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=odine","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/odine","slug":"odine"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/europe.json","web_url":null,"title":"Europe","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=europe","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/europe","slug":"europe"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/startups.json","web_url":null,"title":"startups","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=startups","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/startups","slug":"startups"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":" ODI startup programme to be replicated across Europe\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"ODI helps unlock £11m for open data innovation in Europe","url":"","content":"<h3 id=\"odistartupprogrammetobereplicatedacrosseurope\">ODI startup programme to be replicated across Europe</h3>\n<p><strong>Building on the success of the <a href=\"http://theodi.org/start-ups\">ODI startup programme</a>, training business and research functions, and combining the skills of world-class partners, the EU has committed €14.4m (£11m) to three initiatives to catalyse open data innovation across the region.</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>1. €7.8m Europe-wide incubator programme based on the ODI’s startup programme</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2. €3.7m Europe-wide web data research network</strong></p>\n<p><strong>3. €2.9m new academy to train the next generation of data scientists</strong></p>\n<p>This is the largest direct investment in open data startups in the world, to date.</p>\n<p><strong>Announcing the new investments, Gavin Starks, CEO at the ODI said:</strong>\n“This is a decisive investment by the EU to create open data skills, build capabilities, and provide fuel for open data startups across Europe.

By investing £850,000 in setting up this fund, Government is demonstrating its commitment to delivering this through transparency.Recent evolutions in technology and open data are revolutionising the way citizens interact with their governments and each other. We want to take that a step further and support innovative business ideas that arise from that data. This Immersion Programme will bring together the very best ideas for businesses to use open data, explore the challenges they face and support them with expertise as they tackle those challenges. I look forward to seeing what exciting initiatives grow out of this.”</p>\n<p>Chair of the Data Strategy Board, Stephan Shakespeare said:</p>\n<p>“I feel positive that through the work the ODI have underway the new opportunities offered by the Immersion Programme will be seized by companies and entrepreneurs across the UK. I’m looking forward to real, innovative ideas coming through. This programme complements fully the aims of the Data Strategy Board and the rest of the work we are undertaking”.</p>\n<p><strong>New model</strong></p>\n<p>The ODI Immersion Programme is a new model for developing businesses from open data. Each sector-focused series will span a nine month period and constitute: an initial event where participants and experts shape the challenges; a development period to grow ideas; a creation and innovation weekend where products are developed, tested, judged and funding is awarded and; a review period where funded ideas get access to additional expertise.</p>\n<p>The ODI’s CEO. Gavin Starks said:</p>\n<p>“This new programme is a great way to help ideas emerge. All new businesses are hard work, and open data businesses have their own specific challenges. We will help shorten the path between ideas, experts, and funding: applying structured and rapid feedback within a time-limited programme that will help surface and refine those which show the greatest promise.”</p>\n<p><strong>First series</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/events/immersion-programme\">The first series </a>to be explored through the Immersion Programme is Crime and Justice, beginning in March. Participants will work with a range of specialists and industry experts including for example, police forces, government departments, private security companies and charities. Attendees will innovate using datasets that may include crime data, sentencing statistics, poverty measures and rates of re-offending.</p>\n<p>Further planned Immersion Programme series in 2013 include Energy and the Environment and Personal Data.</p>","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-leeds-goes-live.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-leeds-goes-live","slug":"odi-leeds-goes-live","title":"ODI Leeds goes live","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:55:29+00:00","created_at":"2014-05-06T13:22:06+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>ODI Leeds, one of 18 ODI Nodes around the world, officially opens its doors for business today (6th May).

We want to encourage others to respond to this consultation and would urge them to do so before the deadline on 31st October\".</p>\n<p>The ODI's full letter to the consultation is set out below.<br />\n \u0002</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Letter to the Possible PAF Licence Revision Consultation from the Open Data Institute: 26th October 2012</strong>  </p>\n<p>Dear Sir/Madam,  </p>\n<p>We are writing in response to your call for opinions on the licensing terms and pricing for the Postcode Address File (PAF®). Please feel free to publish this response; we are also publishing it on our own website.  </p>\n<p>The Open Data Institute is a new not-for-profit centre for innovation which aims to maximise the social, environmental and economic value of open data. We have £10m funding over the next five years from the Technology Strategy Board, part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which we will at least match through funding from commercial organisations. As well as raising open data capability in government and enterprise, we seek to support new, innovative start-ups that take advantage of open data in their products and services.  </p>\n<p>We are responding to the PAF® licence consultation because the PAF® is both a key resource for direct use by existing and new businesses and a vital component of many other datasets that, were it not for the restrictive licensing of PAF®, could be released as open data. As such, changes to the licensing terms and pricing of PAF® have impacts far beyond its existing customer base.  </p>\n<p>There is a real opportunity for the PAF® Advisory Board to create economic and social value by radically changing the way in which Royal Mail manages this asset, which is vital not only to Royal Mail but to the country as a whole. We would challenge you to take up this opportunity and press for Royal Mail to release PAF® as open data and we would like to meet with the PAF® Advisory Board, or a relevant working group, to discuss this response.  </p>\n<p>Yours faithfully,  </p>\n<p>Gavin Starks<br />\n CEO  </p>\n<p><strong>Q1 In the interests of simplicity and of fairness do you favour significantly changing the terms and conditions for the supply of PAF®?</strong>  </p>\n<p>Yes. In the interests of both simplicity and fairness, we favour changing the terms and conditions for PAF® such that it is available as open data: made available for free and without restriction on how it is used.  </p>\n<p><strong>Q2 How should the costs of reliable and up-to-date PAF® data be shared?</strong>  </p>\n<p>For the Royal Mail, maintaining a reliable and up-to-date PAF® is a necessary cost of doing business: Royal Mail could not deliver mail without it. Royal Mail should be enabled to recover those costs through charging those who wish to have mail delivered to their properties such as property developers who build new properties and demolish old ones, and both individuals and companies who wish to receive mail.  </p>\n<p>Royal Mail will also save money compared to their current approach by releasing PAF® as open data, as the simpler model of dissemination will be more straightforward technically and not require as many sales or legal staff to be employed by them.  </p>\n<p><strong>Q3 How might the pricing arrangements be developed to stimulate PAF® usage in the economy without adverse effects on data quality or the incentive to Royal Mail to develop PAF® data further?</strong>  </p>\n<p>Delivering PAF® free for commercial and non-commercial reuse will have positive direct and indirect effects on the economy as a whole. Firstly, it will enable new and existing businesses to take advantage of PAF® without the current financial and legal burdens they endure. Secondly, and more importantly, it means that data derived from information within PAF® will be freed for reuse, which will again stimulate new and old businesses to work more efficiently and effectively with address information.  </p>\n<p>The PAF® Advisory Board should not underestimate the enormous \u0002effect that the PAF®'s restrictive licensing has on open-data availability within the UK as a whole. The <a href=\"http://www.adresse-info.dk/Portals/2/Benefit/Value_Assessment_Danish_Address_Data_UK_2010-07-07b.pdf\">release of the Danish address data as open data</a> in has led to a return on investment of 31:1 for direct usage over the first four years (on a spend of €2m) and a return on investment of 70:1 on use in 2010 (on a spend of €0.2m). These figures do not factor in indirect benefits to the economy (from further reusers of the data), and they illustrate how maintenance costs have decreased over time.  </p>\n<p>With the additional use and importance of PAF®, Royal Mail should be able to find willing and trustworthy partners who will also care about developing PAF® and improving its data quality. Royal Mail could develop these partnerships to reduce Royal Mail's maintenance costs by shouldering some of those costs themselves.  </p>\n<p>As proof of this model, we encourage the PAF Board to look at the Expert Participation Programme being run from The National Archives which will bring the government's legislation database up to date — massively improving its data quality in a way that The National Archives cannot do on its own — with assistance from commercial companies, government departments, academic institutions and others. This model is predicated on the availability of legislation as open data, as partners know that their contributions will be freely accessible forever.  </p>\n<p><strong>Q4 Should Royal Mail continue to develop transactional pricing options and should there be a difference between the price for internal purposes (within the organisation) and external usage (through a public facing web site)?</strong>  </p>\n<p>Royal Mail should concentrate on:<br />\n \u0002</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>bringing down the cost of maintaining PAF®, through technical and process improvement</p></li>\n<li><p>increasing its in-house capabilities on publishing open data</p></li>\n<li><p>partnering with organisations that can contribute to PAF®’s maintenance</p></li>\n<li><p>developing charging models for updates to the database</p>\n<p>It should not spend money on developing restrictive licensing and pricing options for the reuse of PAF® data, which limit the potential economic and social value that opening the data could unlock.  </p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Q5 Do you wish to make any observations about the Government move to negotiate a centrally paid flat fee for non-commercial public sector use?</strong>  </p>\n<p>The public sector is one of many potential partners who rely upon PAF® to carry out their day-to-day work. The Royal Mail should cultivate this partnership to ensure that Government is able to effectively contribute to the maintenance of PAF®, supporting its release as open data.  </p>\n<p>If PAF® is not released as open data, the restrictions on the licensing of data derived from PAF® currently restrict Government's ability to effectively implement its Open Data policies. A flat fee for public sector use should include the ability for Government to publish data derived from PAF® as open data.  </p>\n<p><strong>Q6 How might these differences [in requirements regarding timeliness for reusers] be represented in the provision of PAF® without disproportionately complicating the licence conditions? Should the most frequent updating command a premium fee?</strong>  </p>\n<p>From our experience, it seems likely that the easiest way of implementing open access to PAF® would be to provide direct access to the data as currently stored within the database through an API. Dumps of the entire database might also be provided on a daily or weekly basis, coupled with feeds of changes that enable others to keep their versions synchronised with that held by Royal Mail. All these types of access (API, dumps and feeds of changes) should be available as open data, with no fee associated with them.  </p>\n<p><strong>Q7 What frequency of updating would best suit your usage?</strong>  </p>\n<p>Most of our required uses of PAF® would be best satisfied through API access, which is most easily implemented through direct access to current data.  </p>\n<p><strong>Q8 What are your views on:  \n \u0002(a) Direct end-user licensing;  \n \u0002(b) Solutions Providers paying licence fees on behalf of their customers based on a simple banding of end users’ potential use leaving PAF® free at the point of use;  \n \u0002(c) Unchanged arrangements?</strong>  </p>\n<p>All these complex licensing options are the result of PAF® not being available as open data. When choosing between these options, Royal Mail should demonstrate how any of these options leads to a more efficient and effective dissemination and use of PAF®, and more economic benefit to the UK, than its release as open data.  </p>\n<p><strong>Q9 Which [licensing] approach do you favour?</strong>  </p>\n<p>Short, simple licences significantly reduce the barriers to reusing data, particularly by those organisations who cannot afford high legal costs. Open licences tend to be short and simple. We favour an open licence, such as the <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/\">UK Open Government Licence</a>, which is two pages long.  </p>\n<p>We also observe that the complexity of the PAF® licence has a direct impact on the ability of those deriving data from PAF® to work out the limits on their onward licensing of that derived data, and thus has an adverse impact on much potential open data publication within the UK.  </p>\n<p><strong>Q10 Are there other ways in which the UK generic licence could be simplified?</strong>  </p>\n<p>If PAF® is not released under an open licence, we recommend that Royal Mail join the Information Fair Trader Scheme, run by the Office of Public Sector Information within The National Archives, through which they can get advice about how to simplify their licence terms.  </p>\n<p><strong>Q11 How should the definition of a user (currently ‘an individual work station or terminal or hand-held or otherwise portable device internal to the End-User’) be amended in the light of technological developments?</strong>  </p>\n<p>We have no response to this question, but observe that it illustrates the disproportionate effort that must be spent constructing licences that restrict access to, and usage of, PAF®. This effort would be better spent facilitating open access to PAF®.  </p>\n<p><strong>Q12 To what extent should potential disruption and extra costs of adjustment to new arrangements inhibit Royal Mail from making changes?</strong>  </p>\n<p>The impacts of even small changes to licensing conditions are disruptive because they require legal assistance to assess the impact on existing businesses. In contrast, the impacts of adopting an open licence are clear to all concerned, and although potentially disruptive to existing businesses, provide many opportunities for new businesses and thus for economic growth.  </p>\n<p><strong>Q13 Currently licensing arrangements have a 3 year minimum term with annual renewal. Does this meet your requirements or how should it be amended?</strong>  </p>\n<p>We have no response to this question.  </p>\n<p><strong>Q14 If only minimal amendments were to be made to the existing licence what would be your priorities for change?</strong>  </p>\n<p>We have no response to this question.  </p>\n<p><strong>Q15 What suggestions do you wish to make to improve contact between the Board and the market for PAF®?</strong>  </p>\n<p>We would recommend that the Board appoint a member from the start-up / SME community to represent potential reusers of PAF® who currently may not use it due to legal and financial barriers. We would welcome meeting with the Board to help them identify potential members in this group.  </p>\n<p>\u0002</p>","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma

The tools allow citizens and policymakers to personally investigate the effects of the plans using open data for the first time.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://london-fire.labs.theodi.org\">tools</a> show the pattern of effects, based on two parameters: fire service <a href=\"http://data.london.gov.uk/datastore/package/london-fire-brigade-incident-records\">response times to incidents</a>, and data relating to mobile phone activity in particular parts of London across the day, estimating the number of people present in the area, and how many are likely to be affected at those times (crowd data).</p>\n<p>Using just two datasets, the maps and diagrams generated by the researchers show the potential effects of shutting the 10 fire stations earmarked for closure.

With the ODI’s assistance, the company will soon make the data openly and publicly available for the first time.</p>\n<p>Computer modelling is already used worldwide to help make decisions about emergency service provision. However this takes place largely in closed environments, not accessible to the general public. By building tools in an open way, the ODI set out to show how open data can aid transparency in policy-making and give citizens direct access to information. This could help build public confidence in policy decisions and the way they are reached.</p>\n<p>Although the initial pilot has focused on the London FIre Brigade, the tools created by the ODI team could be applied to any emergency services dataset. The ODI is inviting others to get involved by refining and adding to the data and processes.</p>\n<p>The ODI’s Gavin Starks said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Bringing together Telefónica crowd data with data from the London Datastore helps demonstrate the power of combining public and private sector open data. We expect to see a lot of innovation in this kind of collaboration and are really pleased to see Telefónica commit to taking steps to open up data for everyone. We see huge potential to improve policy-making and transparency, to build trust with and create new tools for citizens, and to help create new commercial services.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Steve Alder, CEO Telefónica Dynamic Insights’ said: </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We believe that aggregated and anonymous crowd data - approached in a smart and responsible way - has the potential to transform every part of business and society. In particular, as this research project shows, aggregated and anonymous crowd data can help business and government bodies make big decisions better.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The work will be discussed later today at <a href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/\">the ODI’s first annual Summit</a> </p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-rio-joins-the-global-open-data-network.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-rio-joins-the-global-open-data-network","slug":"odi-rio-joins-the-global-open-data-network","title":"ODI Rio joins the global open data network","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:57:33+00:00","created_at":"2014-10-24T10:04:41+00:00","tag_ids":["news","rio","latin-america","node"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/rio.json","web_url":null,"title":"Rio","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=rio","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/rio","slug":"rio"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/latin-america.json","web_url":null,"title":"Latin America","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=latin-america","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/latin-america","slug":"latin-america"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/node.json","web_url":null,"title":"Node","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=node","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/node","slug":"node"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>ODI Rio, the latest addition to the ODI’s global network, launches today at the Federal university of Rio de Janeiro. </p>","excerpt":"ODI Rio, the latest addition to the ODI’s global network, launches today at the Federal university of Rio de Janeiro. \r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"","url":"","content":"<p>ODI Rio, the latest addition to the ODI’s global network, launches today at the Federal university of Rio de Janeiro. </p>\n<p>The new node is the 22nd ODI Node to join the network (including the UK), after <a href=\"https://twitter.com/odidevon\" title=\"ODI Devon\">ODI Devon</a> which also launched this week. </p>\n<p>ODI Rio will focus mainly on promoting open data within the areas of smart cities and healthcare in the city, as well as sports, with the Rio 2016 Olympics on the horizon.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/4a/2c/544a2c4cd0d46207ed000001/4538075878_0ab2ac6ddd_b.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"544a2c4cf362be7afc00002b\">\n<small><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/seier/4538075878\"><i>Flickr: seier+seier (CCBYSA)</i></a></small></p>\n<p>The Node will be based at the Reference Centre for Entrepreneurial Intelligence at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro – a top university in Latin America with an increasing commitment to data and technological innovation.

“Seika\").</small></p>\n<p><strong>What’s your idea in a nutshell?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://petajakarta.org/banjir/en/\">PetaJakarta.org</a> is an open source flood map for the city of Jakarta, Indonesia, which experiences <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21055978\">severe flooding</a> on an annual basis.</p>\n<p>The map combines citizen reporting, social media, government flood alerts and sensor data to provide information for residents and government during flooding. Critically, <a href=\"https://PetaJakarta.org\">PetaJakarta.org</a> maps the location of flooding in real time, helping the public and emergency services to improve responses to flooding, by helping to answer questions such as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There’s flooding nearby, should I collect my kids from school early?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>... and:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Which neighbourhoods are currently worst affected by flood waters?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sounds interesting! What gave you this idea?</strong></p>\n<p>PetaJakarta.org is a <a href=\"https://smart.uow.edu.au/research/UOW164497.html\">project</a> led by the <a href=\"http://smart.uow.edu.au/osgeo/index.html\">Open Source Geospatial Laboratory (OSGeoLab) at SMART Infrastructure Facility, University of Wollongong.</a> The lab’s focus is on developing new and innovative methods using open source geospatial data to understand the resilience of infrastructure to extreme weather events and climate change.</p>\n<p>Jakarta is cited by the World Bank as being \"<a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/country/indonesia\">data scarce</a>\", and so during flooding there was very little information available.</p>\n<p>But the city has one of the <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/twitter-close-20-million-active-users-indonesia\">highest number of Twitter users</a> on the planet – Indonesians love social media! As researchers, we were intrigued as to whether we could transform social networks into real-time platforms for mapping data collection and information sharing during emergencies. </p>\n<p>\"Peta\" means map in Indonesian; thus the idea for MapJakarta was born.</p>\n<p><strong>When did you first get excited about open data?</strong></p>\n<p>We know that spatial modelling of cities works well in ‘data rich’ countries, but there had been limited use in developing nations. We wanted to explore ways to solve the engineering challenges of the rapidly urbanising cities, which are often ‘data poor’.</p>\n<p>Previously we demonstrated that data from <a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org\">OpenStreetMap</a> – collected by residents in Africa – could be used to solve real-world engineering challenges. If this data wasn’t open or available, we’d never be able to use it for analysis. PetaJakarta.org is really an extension of this idea – we look at how to build tools that enable residents to submit reports to the government and vice-versa in real time. Open data is key to ensuring that everyone has access to the information.</p>\n<p><strong>Where do you see open data in 10 years?</strong></p>\n<p>The PetaJakarta.org project has developed a platform of civic co-management, connecting residents and government during times of need, to help the city respond to extreme weather events. Open data methodologies are critical to this approach so as to build a platform of trust and transparency between stakeholders – ensuring that everyone has access to the same data for decision making. I think this trend will continue as megacities seek new and innovative ways to respond to the challenges of weather intensification, urbanisation and climate change; governments will increasingly need to collect data from and share data with residents, as well as integrating multiple sources of information.</p>\n<p><strong>What are your plans for your project, and how will you achieve them?</strong></p>\n<p>Information is the most important resource during a disaster. The ODI Showcase, through creation of a short video, interactive diagrams and documentation, will help us demonstrate how combining lots of different data from social media reports to river gauge measurements, provides the best possible source of information for decision making during flooding. And by making the map and its data open, we ensure that this information is accessible and useable by individuals, communities and government agencies.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we’ve successfully demonstrated that social media networks can be transformed into emergency communication and coordination networks. All of this research is underpinned by the sharing of software and data in an open manner. This is where the showcase comes in, we need to document the project, to explain the value of its approach and how it offers a practical solution for developing platforms of civic co-management in cities facing extreme weather events. In effect, the output of our ODI Showcase will help us work towards a template of methodologies based on the PetaJakarta.org project, which other cities can use to build their own software and data sharing processes for resilience against a range of different types of disaster.</p>\n<p><em>Stay tuned for updates on the Peta Jakarta ODI Showcase project, and follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/petajkt?lang=en\">@petajkt</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iHolderness?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@iHolderness</a> on Twitter.</em></p>\n<p><em>Dr Tomas Holderness is a Chartered Geographer and leads the <a href=\"https://smart.uow.edu.au/about/index.html\">Open Geospatial Laboratory at the SMART Infrastructure Facility, University of Wollongong</a>, where he is Co-Chief Investigator on the PetaJakarta.org project alongside Dr Etienne Turpin.

In that time the team has built up a database of over 10,000 toilets from open data and crowdsourcing to help people find toilets when away from home. Now they want to take it a step further, by analysing the map’s data to find out how public toilets are provided in the UK and who can access them. The team also plans to investigate how toilet provision compares across the country, factoring in differences in population, environment and age, which could affect local demand for facilities. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-showcase-winners-qa-great-british-toilet-map\"><em>Find out more in the Q&A with the team</em></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"energysparks\">Energy Sparks</h3>\n<p>Energy Sparks aims to help schools become more energy efficient by giving them better access to their energy usage data and presenting it on a platform so the whole school can access and use it.

He said:</p>\n<p>“Open data serves three objectives. They are all complimentary and overlap. Firstly, for the public to scrutinise what we do, where we spend the money and how we fail. \u0002Second, to inform choice in public services. \u0002And thirdly, to encourage economic growth by incubating data orientated business. Data is a raw material and it fuels social and economic growth to enrich communities and citizens”.</p>\n<p>Dozens of friends and supporters from government, charities and the business and technology communities attended the event. Reflecting on his ambitions for the ODI Nigel Shadbolt said: “Together we are building a new infrastructure that is no longer about fibres and servers but what is at the end of these things.

The minister in charge of the TSB, David Willetts said the ODI’s mission to train a new cohort of open data developers through its post-graduate diploma and other courses will be crucial:</p>\n<p>“We need cutting edge scientists to write systems for the very large data sets that we have, making them more usable and adding to the flow of data. We need to generate skills to analyse data, this isn’t something you can’t do without education and training”.</p>\n<p><strong>Affiliations</strong></p>\n<p>The main features of the agreement with the World Bank will be to help collect evidence globally on the benefits of open data and to train senior people who will lead open data initiatives in developing countries. Andrew Stott, Senior Consultant with the World Bank and member of the Cabinet Office Transparency Board said: “I am delighted that the ODI and the World Bank will be working together to deliver first class open data programmes in the developing world”.</p>\n<p>Announcing the affiliation with the World Bank, CEO Gavin Starks said: “This agreement is further evidence of the momentum being generated by open data. That organisations like the World Bank and Omidyar Network are stepping forward to work with us demonstrates the emerging open data culture.

Since the project began in January 2013, Demand Logic has identified:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Energy savings of £390,000 per year</li>\n<li>Carbon savings of 2500 tonnes per year</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This latest initiative covers three campuses: Guy’s, Denmark Hill and the Strand. Approximately 100 buildings ranging considerably in size and usage pattern were involved in the project, over 1500 plant items were tracked (including boilers, pumps and air-conditioning units) and over 100,000 sensors and devices were monitored.</p>\n<p>The Demand Logic platform identifies energy saving opportunities in the heating, cooling and ventilation systems which are extremely hard to pinpoint in large, complex buildings. The system works by analysing data generated by the building control systems, which often stays hidden.</p>\n<p>Demand Logic found that the College's facilities were generally running very efficiently, and their controls were excellent. But a lack of data analysis capability meant that many problems had not been found.</p>\n<p>In one case, boilers were rapidly cycling on and off because they did not have enough load. The team also found several conflicting \"set points\" (temperature settings) had been applied to the same open plan office, causing both heating and cooling of the same space.</p>\n<p>In one particular instance, having discovered a large chiller running all day in the middle of winter, the system then found a single office that was causing the problem. This room was being heated by a personal electric heater which was fighting the centralised cooling plant. This discovery was only possible because the Demand Logic system monitors hundreds of ceiling-mounted air-conditioning outlets in the building, and was able to identify one which was demanding more from the central plant.</p>\n<p>Mike Darby, Chief Technical Officer, Demand Logic, said:</p>\n<p>\"This is just the beginning at King's. The system found the low-hanging fruit quite early on, and then we focussed on developing even better methods for analysing data. Now these are going live, I am convinced we'll find many more savings.\"</p>\n<p>Ian Armitage, Campus Operations Manager at King's College London, said:</p>\n<p>\"I believe that good control systems in buildings are the key to saving energy without compromising user comfort. Demand Logic has helped the College to find a host of issues about how our heating and cooling plant is controlled, leading to significant savings which we are using to fund investment in our student facing facilities. Our campus buildings generate a vast amount of data, but accessing and analysing this is a real challenge. The Demand Logic web system allows us to see at a glance where problems are likely to be. Without this, it's like trying to find a needle in a haystack.\"</p>\n<p>Gavin Starks, CEO of the Open Data Institute said:</p>\n<p>“Energy efficiency is an easy way to save money, but if you’re not measuring it you can’t manage it. Demand Logic’s latest project highlights how you can both save money, and increase sustainability - at a time when fuel bills are rising and the latest IPCC report continues to highlight the urgent need for action.”</p>\n<p>\u0002</p>","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Helen Desmond","slug":"helen-desmond","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/helen-desmond","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Helen Desmond","slug":"helen-desmond","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/helen-desmond","tag_ids":[]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-startup-opendatasoft-partners-with-odis-north-carolina-node-to-create-smart-government-solutions.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-startup-opendatasoft-partners-with-odis-north-carolina-node-to-create-smart-government-solutions","slug":"odi-startup-opendatasoft-partners-with-odis-north-carolina-node-to-create-smart-government-solutions","title":"ODI startup OpenDataSoft partners with ODI’s North Carolina Node to create Smart Government solutions","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:56:32+00:00","created_at":"2014-07-29T08:52:31+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"Two open data companies from the ODI’s growing network, one French, one American, have today announced they are forging a partnership.

Key findings of the analysis include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Between 2011 and 2014, more than 78k small companies delivered contracts for local authorities with a total value of £11.1bn</p></li>\n<li><p>In contrast, total spend with the \"top twenty\" companies was £9.9bn in the same period</p></li>\n<li><p>Local authorities are making best use of small firms in sectors including social care, construction and business support. Very little spending takes place with small businesses in accounting, financial services and advertising</p></li>\n<li><p>Spending with small firms is not influenced by political control, geographical spread or average earnings for the region. It is positively affected by explicit policies to boost procurement from SMEs</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>To carry out the analysis, the research team mapped 44m transactions from 150 councils in England and Wales to over 190,000 company records published by <a href=\"http://www.opencorporates.com\">Open Corporates</a>, another ODI Startup company.  </p>\n<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>\n<p>The report makes several recommendations, including that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Each council should publish a pipeline of contracts becoming available in the coming year</p></li>\n<li><p>Government and the Local Government Association [LGA] should work with Spend Network and the ODI to develop a common framework for local authorities to report on SME spend</p></li>\n<li><p>Every UK public body should publish spending over £500 rather than the current £25k minimum for some public bodies</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Commenting on the work, Spend Network CEO, Ian Makgill said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our analysis, based on open data is the first insight into local government spending on a national scale and is a testament to the power of open data in action. We can't assume that all spending with small firms will equate to improved economic development but research has shown that small firms are a key source for job creation and economic growth. So we hope that this will be a useful contribution to small business success and economic growth across the UK.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The ODI’s Technical Director, Jeni Tennison said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is encouraging to see open data being used to shed new light on the way the public sector procures products and services from small businesses. It’s also good to see ODI Startups - which are, after all, UK small businesses built on open data - bringing new levels of insight to this subject. </p>\n  <p>Whilst today’s report reveals that there is still a lot of work to do, we are already seeing signs that the public sector is serious in its commitment to publishing and using more open data. ODUG and Release of Data Fund backed <a href=\"http://incentive.opendata.esd.org.uk/\">Local Government Open Data Incentive Scheme</a>, for example, is promoting greater transparency using open data, as recommended in today’s report.

This set out steps the next government could take to strengthen the UK’s <a href=\"http://theodi.org/what-is-data-infrastructure\">data infrastructure</a>, and maximise the benefits of open data. </p>\n<p>One year on, there are recommendations set out in the roadmap that are more urgent than ever; there are some that seem blindingly obvious in retrospect; and there are needs we have now that weren’t mentioned in the roadmap at all. </p>\n<p>While the UK’s <a href=\"https://data.blog.gov.uk/category/government-data-programme/\">Government Data Programme</a> – coordinated by Government Digital Service – is accelerating work on data-sharing, ethics and registers, open data remains frustratingly siloed. </p>\n<p>The ODI’s roadmap set out <a href=\"http://theodi.org/roadmap-uk-2015\">nine suggestions</a> for the next UK Government on open data, from refining its open data strategy to generating impact from open data and maximising reuse. The roadmap saw open data as a core part of a wider government data strategy – a mechanism to help uncover and map how data is used and shared inside government (as shared data), and to create value for businesses collaborating with government. This blog outlines current challenges for government highlighted in the roadmap, and emerging gaps the roadmap didn’t cover. </p>\n<h3 id=\"keydatachallengesforgovernment\">Key data challenges for government</h3>\n<p><strong>The importance of data as infrastructure is not widely recognised</strong></p>\n<p>The ODI’s roadmap highlighted the need to build on and refine work on the UK’s National Information Infrastructure, moving beyond a static list of public sector datasets. Since the election, government work on defining and setting rules for essential data infrastructure – inside and outside government – has stalled. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/data-infrastructure\">Data is infrastructure</a> – not only for the public sector, but the wider economy. It underpins public service transformation, business innovation and democratic engagement. The UK Government Data Programme espouses the importance of data infrastructure, but while a National Infrastructure Commission has been <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/508109/DOC150316-15032016124609.pdf\">established</a> by government, data isn’t a part of it. </p>\n<p>There are some standout departments accelerating their investment in data infrastructure and open data. In June 2015, Secretary of State for Defra Liz Truss announced the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/environment-secretary-speech-on-the-future-of-food-and-farming\">‘biggest data giveaway the UK has ever seen</a>’, committing to publishing 8,000 datasets as open data in 12 months and transforming how the department uses data in general. The project goes beyond publishing more data; it’s a change to an open culture. The <a href=\"https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/08/18/mapping-new-ideas-for-the-digital-justice-system-2/\">Ministry of Justice</a>, <a href=\"https://dwptechnology.blog.gov.uk/2016/02/04/the-appliance-of-data-science/\">DWP</a> and <a href=\"http://digital.nhs.uk/we-need-to-open-up-gp-data\">NHS</a> have all written about their own data work. </p>\n<p>Open registers are part the UK’s data infrastructure, and the Government Data Programme has been <a href=\"https://data.blog.gov.uk/2013/05/15/developing-a-national-core-reference-data-set/\">investing</a> in core reference data that lots of services need. But registers aren’t the only kind of data in our data infrastructure. They’ll need to supplement rather than replace existing mechanisms for publishing core data where they’re already working, via APIs and as static data assets. </p>\n<p>The Government Data Programme has been exploring opening up core data assets that are part of the UK’s data infrastructure. The <a href=\"https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/03/23/an-open-address-register/\">2016 Budget included up to £5m</a> to explore options for an open, authoritative address register. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OpenDefra&src=typd\">#OpenDefra</a> has seen the release of high-value datasets like <a href=\"https://defradigital.blog.gov.uk/2016/03/17/exploring-the-laser-cloud/\">LIDAR</a>, which provides digital elevation information for three quarters of the UK. However, the openness of data maintained by bodies that may be privatised – like the Land Registry – is <a href=\"http://theodi.org/news/new-research-exposes-risk-privatising-land-registry-restricting-data\">at risk.</a> </p>\n<p><strong>Open data in government is getting more disjointed, not connected</strong> </p>\n<p>The ODI’s roadmap emphasised the need to embed open data as fundamental to a comprehensive data strategy for government. There’s still a team working on open data as part of the Government Data Programme, but if anything it seems open data is more fragmented than before the general election. </p>\n<p>Responsibility for open data is now generally split across two departments: GDS and the Government Data Programme, who are exploring data use inside government which will feed into the Government Digital Strategy, and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), who are asking questions about open data and its use by businesses and third-sector organisations in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/national-innovation-plan-call-for-ideas\">National Innovation Plan</a>. The split between departments may make sense if it weaves open data into the natural perspectives and scope for policy interventions within the two departments. But joining up efforts will take strong leadership. </p>\n<p>Data policies have not been joined up in consultations from the Government Data Programme itself, with the ‘<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xj5fZHkxnwGwpGNjeyoYviZhbYYNbBwO8QqyZyQfzJI/edit#heading=h.mmzqvnva5k34\">Better use of data’ consultation</a> noticeably missing policies linked to open data, accessibility of data via open APIs and data science ethics.</p>\n<p>And while the focus for the Government Data Programme is <a href=\"https://data.blog.gov.uk/2015/09/25/our-plan-for-data-2/\">public</a>, targets and metrics for its initiatives such as for open data aren’t, making it hard to meaningfully evaluate progress. </p>\n<p><strong>There’s a vacuum in public-sector senior data leadership</strong></p>\n<p>The roadmap recommended appointing a Chief Data Officer for government, and it still seems there’s a lack of senior leadership and championing of data across government. In late March 2015 Mike Bracken was appointed <a href=\"https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/28/data-as-a-public-asset/\">Chief Data Officer for the UK</a>, alongside his role as Executive Director of Digital in the Cabinet Office and head of GDS. Since Mike’s departure in August 2015 from GDS, no new Chief Data Officer has been appointed. As the Government Data Programme ramps up, and more departments begin to invest in data science, open data and data infrastructure projects, that authoritative voice becomes essential to champion and communicate the big picture for data in the UK; to hold government to account when things go wrong – for example, the <a href=\"http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2016/05/10/ellen-broad-and-tom-sasse-google-deep-in-trust-issues-around-use-of-uk-patient-data/\">Google DeepMind and NHS Royal Free data-sharing arrangement</a>; and to ultimately drive improvements over time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ukgovernmentsdatahighlights\">UK Government’s data highlights</h3>\n<p>The Government Data Programme’s work on registers – recognising certain kinds of reference data as an essential ‘spine’ for linking up public services – is a promising step that has already been mentioned above. </p>\n<p><strong>Open contracting got a Prime Ministerial boost</strong></p>\n<p>It’s also been great to see the government’s commitment to open contracting and open procurement data continued. At the 2016 Anti-Corruption Summit hosted by Prime Minister David Cameron, the UK became the first G7 country to commit to the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) for contracts administered by the Crown Commercial Service. Government should go further though. To drive competition and better services, open should be baked into contracts with government, so that where data is collected, maintained, and used with public funding, the outputs are as open as possible for everyone to benefit from. </p>\n<p><strong>Government convened sectors to solve problems using open data and open APIs</strong></p>\n<p>There have been exciting initiatives outside government, with government convening support around open data and open APIs. The <a href=\"https://theodi.org/news/uk-open-banking-working-group-publishes-report\">Open Banking Standard work</a> – co-chaired by the ODI and Barclays – aims to make it possible for consumer banking data to be shared efficiently and securely, for citizens’ benefit. The recommendations from the Open Banking Working Group’s final report were incorporated by the CMA in its recent <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-wants-banks-to-work-harder-for-their-customers\">recommendations to reform UK banking</a>, and work in this space continues to evolve rapidly.</p>\n<p><strong>UK Cabinet Minister advocated for ‘dogfooding’ open data</strong></p>\n<p>In late 2015 Cabinet Minister Matt Hancock became the first politician to use the term ‘dogfooding’ in an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/open-data-matt-hancock-speech\">official speech</a> in Berlin, highlighting using open data inside government as a priority for the Government Data Programme:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Government using our own data, ‘hundefutter’, or dogfooding as it is called in English, also ensures that we publish high quality data because we know what it feels like to use it. This is taken from a US Chief Executive of a dog food company who ate a can of his own product to prove its quality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Encouraging civil servants to consume open data, not just publish it, was a recommendation from the ODI’s roadmap and it was fantastic to hear it have Ministerial endorsement. However, it’s not clear how successful this effort from the Government Data Programme has yet been in practice. This ‘dogfooding’ will be key for data publishers inside government to grasp the quality of their data, how it might be improved and how others might use it (or not be able to use it). </p>\n<h3 id=\"whatdidwemissintheroadmap\">What did we miss in the roadmap?</h3>\n<p><strong>Engagement with the data community</strong></p>\n<p>At the time going into the general election, there were a range of data-related engagement groups: the Open Data User Group (ODUG), the Government Transparency Panel, the Open Standards Board and more. Engagement with data users didn’t feature in our roadmap. </p>\n<p>Since the election, a Data Leaders Network has been established, comprising of leaders within government, and a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/data-steering-group#minutes\">Data Steering Group</a> of external data visionaries. The Open Data User Group (ODUG) hasn’t been renewed, and as yet there is no formal engagement strategy in place for communicating with the wider data community, outside of the ODI, which has been asked to <a href=\"https://theodi.org/blog/odi-welcomes-new-role-with-cabinet-office\">reflect the needs of its members</a>. The latest UK National Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership points to the Open Government Network as its platform for engagement on some aspects of data and open government, but again, the OGN reflects a subsection of the UK data community. Other voices and perspectives need to be taken into account, as well. </p>\n<p><strong>Personal data-sharing, data science and ethics</strong></p>\n<p>There’s work to be done to address the <a href=\"http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2016/05/10/ellen-broad-and-tom-sasse-google-deep-in-trust-issues-around-use-of-uk-patient-data/\">data trust deficit</a> between citizens and organisations managing and using our personal data. The ODI has been working on draft <a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/bringing-together-privacy-and-openness-the-odi-shares-draft-personal-data-principles\">design principles</a> for managing personal data: bringing together openness and privacy to build trust. Several of these reflect requirements of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation\">EU General Data Protection Regulation</a>, which will be in force in the UK by the end of 2017. We’re working now to expand the principles in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and build practical guidelines for organisations handling data ethically. </p>\n<p>The Cabinet Office’s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-science-ethical-framework\">data science ethical framework</a> was launched in May. The simplicity of the framework is refreshing, and the team’s skillful use of the open policy-making process to test and adapt its recommendations is an exemplar for government. Just as data projects and what is considered ‘ethical’ evolves and changes, so the framework will adapt, with the team committed to continuing to update the framework after launch. </p>\n<p><strong>Open data and data infrastructure for cities and regions</strong></p>\n<p>Since the general election, cities have been forging their own paths on data. As the devolution deals are finalised, we’re working with our network of ODI members and UK ODI Nodes to ensure that city data infrastructure is as open as possible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatareyourthoughts\">What are your thoughts?</h3>\n<p>Plans around data transformation within government, and for the UK generally, continue to evolve rapidly. Alongside GDS in the Cabinet Office, other departments are starting to grapple with their role and responsibilities setting data policies and ideas into practice – it’s part of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/national-innovation-plan-call-for-ideas\">BIS Innovation Plan call for ideas</a>, and fundamental to the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-boost-for-digital-economy\">UK-France Data Taskforce report</a> being overseen by Treasury and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. </p>\n<p>What exciting work do you see happening that we should highlight? What other areas do you want to see more progress made in? How can the enthusiasm and willingness to engage with data use inside and outside government – and the role of open data to deliver this – be harnessed to contribute towards a cohesive, visionary UK Government data strategy?

It is a privilege to be involved in this important work.\"</em></p>\n<p><strong>Gavin Starks</strong>, CEO at the Open Data Institute said: </p>\n<p><em>\"Open standards and open data will help reduce friction in the economy, and enable the UK to trade effectively in the digital economy. For consumers and businesses this will help improve their interaction with services, and enable new services to emerge that help them manage their finances. For banks and FinTech innovators I believe there are substantial opportunities for both efficiencies and innovation.\"</em> </p>\n<h3 id=\"keyobwgparticipants\">Key OBWG participants</h3>\n<p>Direct participants in the Steering Committee of the Working Group will be drawn from representatives of the British Banking Association, Payments UK, Innovate Finance, FDATA, COADEC and Digital Catapult, and include other individuals with expertise and perspectives directly relevant to the work's objectives, drawn from across industry. </p>\n<p>EY (Ernst &amp; Young) has kindly volunteered to provide pro-bono support to the working group. A range of channels will be developed as the work progresses through which any interested party can share any perspectives that they wish. Interested individuals and parties can find out more by contacting Henry Kuang of EY at hkuang@uk.ey.com.</p>\n<h3 id=\"faq\">FAQ</h3>\n<p><strong>Q. Why is the UK doing this?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A.</strong> In this year’s Budget the Chancellor committed to delivering an open API standard in UK banking, and setting out a detailed framework for its design by the end of 2015, in order to help drive more competition and innovation in banking for the benefit of consumers. The Open Banking Working Group (OBWG) has been tasked with taking this work forward, bringing together a diverse range of stakeholders across government and the banking and FinTech industries in order to do so.  </p>\n<p>In addition, it will build on the UK’s leadership position in open data worldwide, ensuring the UK keeps ahead on this critical agenda item to protect our economic interests and further establish the UK as a leader in FinTech. The work will also position the UK well to help shape implementation of emerging European regulation in the space of open data (PSD II).</p>\n<p><strong>Q. What is an open API, what is open data, and what is an open data API?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A.</strong> An <strong>open API</strong> is a means of accessing data based on an open standard: it is a public interface. An open standard is developed and maintained collaboratively and transparently, and can be accessed and used by anyone. The data accessed via an open API may be closed, shared or open data. </p>\n<p>A detailed definition can be found <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/open-standards-and-licensing.html\" title=\"here\">here</a>. </p>\n<p>Data exists on a spectrum of accessibility. The data spectrum ranges from closed to shared to open. A simple visualisation of this definition can be found <a href=\"http://theodi.org/data-spectrum\" title=\"here\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Open data</strong> is data that anyone can access, use and share. An <strong>open data API</strong>, therefore, is a public interface that provides access to open data. An example of open data in this context could be financial product information.</p>\n<p><strong>Q. Does this mean any personal data will be released as open data?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A.</strong> No. It is categorically not the case that any individual’s personal bank details or a company’s transaction data are going to be licensed or made public as open data as a result of this work. For the avoidance of doubt, the open API enables developers to integrate with a service to create new, value-added services for individuals and businesses. Those developers will need explicit permission to access, use or transact with any confidential information and appropriate security will need to be built around any interface that provides to maintain the privacy and security of the underlying data.</p>\n<p><strong>Q. What benefit might an open API have for users, innovators, banks and regulators?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A.</strong> There are many potential benefits. We have provided some limited examples below.</p>\n<p><em>Banking customers</em><br>\nAn open API should enable bank customers (both consumer and business) to access their data in a structured, machine-readable form. This will enable them to more easily grant permission to access (or share directly) this information with other services and applications.</p>\n<p><em>Innovators</em><br>\nEasier access to data reduces friction for innovators, lowers transaction costs, increases speed to market and produces better quality for end-consumers of their innovation. This should drive far greater benefit to individuals and businesses, enhancing competition and the overall service experience.</p>\n<p><em>Banks</em><br>\nBanks will benefit from reduced costs, increased innovation and more engaged customers.</p>\n<p><em>Regulators</em><br>\nRegulators will benefit from more competition, heightening the ability of the market to self-police through switching behaviour of customers that will penalise providers that do not create and maintain high-quality services that add value to their customers.</p>\n<p><strong>Q. What impact might an open data API have for users, innovators, banks and regulators?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A.</strong> We provide some examples below. </p>\n<p><em>Banking customers</em><br>\nBanking customers will benefit from increased competition in the sector, through greater transparency of products and services, and through new product innovation.</p>\n<p><em>Innovators</em><br>\nProviding access to, for example, all available products enables new services to be created or existing services to be enhanced, such as product comparison.</p>\n<p><em>Banks</em><br>\nBanks will benefit from reduced costs, increased innovation and more engaged customers.</p>\n<p><em>Regulators</em><br>\nRegulators will have easier access to the products and services which they are required to regulate. An open reporting standard could simplify reporting and collection of regulatory data. Open data could also increase transparency by providing greater access to regulatory information. </p>\n<p><strong>Q. How will the working group ensure its recommendations benefit users?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A.</strong> The working group is explicitly structured to ensure user needs are clearly identified through sub-groups, access to focus groups / research and involvement from a broad range of participants including trade associations, FinTech innovators, and banks. A number of channels will be established to ensure that any interested party or individual is able to share their perspectives with the working group. Interested parties or individuals should contact Henry Kuang of EY at hkuang@uk.ey.com to express their interest. </p>\n<p><strong>Q. What is happening next?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A.</strong> The working group is defining its purpose and principles. Further notices will be published on an ongoing basis to ensure that the process for defining open banking is, itself, open. </p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-data-means-business.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/open-data-means-business","slug":"open-data-means-business","title":"Research: Open data means business","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-05-24T08:59:39+00:00","created_at":"2015-04-23T13:56:34+00:00","tag_ids":["page","open-data-means-business","business","research","uk","startups"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-banking-working-group-terms-of-reference.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/open-banking-working-group-terms-of-reference","slug":"open-banking-working-group-terms-of-reference","title":"Open Banking Working Group: Terms of Reference","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-10-06T09:49:47+00:00","created_at":"2015-10-02T15:54:28+00:00","tag_ids":["news","open-banking-working-group","finance"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-call-future-data-pioneers.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/open-call-future-data-pioneers","slug":"open-call-future-data-pioneers","title":"ODI calls for future data pioneers to speak at ODI Summit","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-09-23T11:23:40+00:00","created_at":"2016-09-21T11:14:48+00:00","tag_ids":["news","summit","tim-berners-lee","nigel-shadbolt","martha-lane-fox","neelie-kroes","generation-open"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/summit.json","web_url":null,"title":"Summit","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=summit","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/summit","slug":"summit"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/tim-berners-lee.json","web_url":null,"title":"Tim Berners-Lee","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=tim-berners-lee","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/tim-berners-lee","slug":"tim-berners-lee"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/nigel-shadbolt.json","web_url":null,"title":"Nigel Shadbolt","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=nigel-shadbolt","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/nigel-shadbolt","slug":"nigel-shadbolt"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/martha-lane-fox.json","web_url":null,"title":"Martha Lane Fox","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=martha-lane-fox","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/martha-lane-fox","slug":"martha-lane-fox"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/neelie-kroes.json","web_url":null,"title":"Neelie Kroes","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=neelie-kroes","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/neelie-kroes","slug":"neelie-kroes"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/generation-open.json","web_url":null,"title":"generation open","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=generation-open","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/generation-open","slug":"generation-open"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>We are launching an open call for young people aged 16-30 to share with us how they think data can solve a local or global problem.

[The ODI](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ukodi/20483826975/in/album-72157664805747771/ “The ODI\").</small></p>\n<p><em><strong>By Anna Scott and Tom Sasse</strong></em></p>\n<p>Today, the Open Data Barometer published its third <a href=\"http://opendatabarometer.org/3rdEdition/report/\">global report</a>. The report is the third in a series which aims to uncover the ‘true prevalence’ and impact of open data initiatives around the world. The Open Data Barometer <a href=\"http://opendatabarometer.org/3rdEdition/methodology/\">analyses</a> global trends and ranks countries and regions to explore open data readiness, implementation and impact. This is based on contextual data (eg on data availability, licensing and discoverability), technical assessments, and secondary indicators (based on independent expert surveys, such as those by the World Economic Forum and the World Bank). </p>\n<p>The report bolsters increasing global awareness of a growing open data movement. While the usual high-performers have held their top spots – namely the UK and the US – they are being challenged by a new generation of open data adopters in most regions, such as France and Canada in Europe and North America respectively, Korea, Japan, Singapore and the Philippines in Asia, and Mexico and Uruguay in Latin America. Commitments and initiatives elsewhere are growing fast; the majority of countries in the survey (55%) now have an open data initiative. </p>\n<p>The report also promotes the value of open data, saying it can \"result in net savings for the public purse\", and echoing <a href=\"http://theodi.org/news/new-research-exposes-risk-privatising-land-registry-restricting-data\">new economic research</a> released by the ODI demonstrating how open data creates growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical gaps in impact and the need for solid foundations</strong></p>\n<p>However, in spite of growing commitments and awareness of open data's potential, implementation and impact of open data initiatives has wavered across the index – in some cases, country scores in these areas have declined. Less than 10% of government data that is available is open, and scores for open data’s impact on accountability have fallen by 22%. Other critical gaps that were observed include a burgeoning ‘data divide’ between developed and developing contexts (26 of the top 30 are high-income countries), underdeveloped initiatives at the sub-national level, and limited innovation support programmes to take advantage of open data in the medium- to long-term. These gaps limit the potential impact that open data can have, particularly in addressing the <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?menu=1300\">Sustainable Development Goals</a>.</p>\n<p>The report also highlights the importance of putting the right foundations and <a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/what-would-legislation-for-data-infrastructure-look-like\">legal frameworks</a> in place in order for open data initiatives to flourish and avoid ‘open washing’, namely freedom of information and privacy legislation, and tapping into supportive global initiatives and peer networks – such as the <a href=\"http://od4d.net/\">Open Data for Development Network</a> and the <a href=\"http://opendatacharter.net/\">International Open Data Charter</a>, of which the ODI is a Lead Steward. Peer networks and initiatives like these are key to help governments increase the impact of open data in their countries by providing technical and policy guidance and sharing lessons learned.</p>\n<p><strong>Emerging trends and lessons in supporting open data initiatives</strong></p>\n<p>These approaches align with ODI research published today on emerging trends and best practice in supporting open data initiatives to implement successful, impactful open data initiatives. The series of ‘methods reports’ focus on <a href=\"http://theodi.org/method-report-how-to-create-and-sustain-peer-networks-for-open-data-leaders\">how to create and sustain peer networks for open data leaders</a>, <a href=\"http://theodi.org/method-report-assessment-tools-for-open-data-initiatives\">how to support the capacity of open data initiatives with assessment tools</a> and <a href=\"http://theodi.org/method-report-lessons-on-supporting-public-sector-open-data-leadership\">lessons learned on supporting public sector open data leadership</a>, based on the ODI’s experience working with open data leaders around the world. </p>\n<p>Key lessons from the research were that peer networks – such as the ODI’s own <a href=\"http://theodi.org/open-data-leaders-network\">Open Data Leaders Network</a> (ODLN) – have been shown to boost personal and professional development in open data leaders, that flexibility is important in designing leadership programmes to allow for changing learning needs, that careful selection criteria is key to maintaining the quality of peer networks (members should be ‘network-thinkers’) and that support programmes need to be evaluated in terms of their own effectiveness, just as the open data initiatives they aim to help. </p>\n<p>\"Although the ODLN was started as a small experiment, I am very encouraged by some of the multiplier effects seen,\" says <a href=\"http://theodi.org/team/fiona-smith\">Fiona Smith</a>, ODI International Development Manager. \"Members have shared advice with each other on licensing, how to overcome certain implementation challenges, and creative ideas on engaging with the user community. These initial seeds have turned into concrete actions in the leaders' home countries. These promising developments show what is possible through connecting entrepreneurial public sector leaders in a peer network, and by giving them tools such as strategic assessments to help leaders generate their own solutions.\"</p>\n<p>Indeed, some of the open data leaders in countries that have gained prominence in this year’s Open Data Barometer engaged in peer learning as members of the ODLN. For instance, Mexico has emerged as a new regional leader, climbing eight places in the barometer since 2014. Mexico <a href=\"http://theodi.org/news/open-data-enshrined-mexico-constitution?utm_content=buffer0f40d&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer\">enshrined open data into its federal regulation</a> in February 2015. At the time, its Director of Open Data Policy Enrique Zapata was attending the first ODLN gathering in London, amongst other leaders from emerging challenger countries including Macedonia, Moldova and Malaysia. </p>\n<p>Another country with an active open data initiative and showing promise to become an emerging challenger is Burkina Faso, where open data has been used to improve transparency around political transition, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/dec/04/why-data-was-crucial-to-burkina-fasos-first-election-since-uprising\">notably</a> in support of its freest and fairest elections in 30 years, held on 29 November 2015. Malick Tapsoba of the Burkina Faso Open Data Initiative was an ODLN participant earlier this year, and shared his experiences widely. </p>\n<p><strong>Looking ahead: turning commitment into impact</strong></p>\n<p>Success stories and developments such as these show what is possible with the backing of global initiatives, peer networks and assessment tools. But more work is needed to develop policies and support governments to implement impactful open data initiatives tied to solving real social, environmental and economic challenges. </p>\n<p>We encourage governments to adopt the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/207772/Open_Data_Charter.pdf\">Open Data Charter principles</a> and to join a peer-learning network. That's why in 2016 the ODI will continue to support open data leadership around the world through facilitating new cohorts of ODLN, strengthening global and national policy frameworks. </p>\n<p>We also encourage governments to support problem-oriented practical initiatives that put open data into action to help address the Sustainable Development Goals, for example through the <a href=\"http://www.godan.info/\">Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition</a> network. In particular, we will be supporting open data innovation challenges that ensure open data is used in the products and services that can affect people's lives.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Anna Scott is <a href=\"https://theodi.org/team/anna-scott\">Writer / Editor</a> and Tom Sasse is Services Intern at the ODI.

alt=\"null\" class=\"img pull-right\" id=\"56a10909d0d4620677000049\"> </p>\n<p>Today we’re pleased to announce new updates to <a href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/\">Open Data Certificate</a>, introducing refreshed badge levels, an auto-certification tool and improved website to make certifying quality open data publishing easier. </p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<p>In just a year and a half since launching <a href=\"http://opendata.institute/blog/open-data-certificates-beta\">Open Data Certificates in beta</a> we have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>published over 150,000 certificates</li>\n<li>localised certificates for 10 countries across Europe, North America and Asia, </li>\n<li>received valuable feedback from the publishing and reuser community to develop Open Data Certificate further</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"introducingbronzesilvergoldandplatinumbadges\">Introducing Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum badges</h3>\n<p>We believe that achieving a certificate at any level is important; every certificate helps to recognise the sustainable publication of open data and encourage its reuse. In response to community feedback, we have simplified and renamed the certificate badges (previously Raw, Pilot, Standard and Expert) to a universal grading system of Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. This naming mechanism will help users to understand the measures taken to ensure a dataset’s quality, maintenance and support provided.</p>\n<p>For those already with certificates, any embedded badges will update automatically to the new badge icon and name.</p>\n<h3 id=\"anewautocertificationtoolmakesbulkcertificationeasier\">A new auto-certification tool makes bulk certification easier</h3>\n<p>To make the process of certifying existing open data faster and easier, we have created a <a href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/en/autocertification\">free auto-certification tool</a> that automatically drafts multiple Open Data Certificates in one go. </p>\n<p>Available for data publishers using CKAN or DCAT, the tool uses existing metadata stored in a data portal to fill in as many answers as possible. This makes it easier for publishers to kickstart the certification process and focus on adding extra information not already captured.</p>\n<h3 id=\"localisationin10countries\">Localisation in 10 countries</h3>\n<p>To apply Open Data Certificate to varying best practices and legal frameworks around the world, we have been working with local experts to translate them in other countries. Open Data Certificate is now part-localised in Greece, Canada, Czech Republic, Mexico, Italy, Taiwan, US, Romania and Germany. <a href=\"mailto:certificate@theodi.org\">Get it touch</a> if you would like to get involved in bringing Open Data Certificate to your country.</p>\n<p><strong>If you would like to know more about the changes to Open Data Certificate, please visit the new <a href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/\">website</a> for more details.</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>We’d love to know what you think of the changes, please get in touch at <a href=\"mailto:certificate@theodi.org\">certificate@theodi.org</a> or tweet us <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ODILabs\">@ODILabs</a>.</strong></em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Patrice John-Baptiste","slug":"patrice-johnbaptiste","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/patrice-johnbaptiste","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme","team-member"]}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"Open Data Certificate website","url":"https://certificates.theodi.org/"}],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-data-certificates-beta.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/open-data-certificates-beta","slug":"open-data-certificates-beta","title":"Open Data Certificates Beta","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:51:23+00:00","created_at":"2013-06-14T12:13:34+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/new-certificates-launched-help-everyone-discover-understand-and-use-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/new-certificates-launched-help-everyone-discover-understand-and-use-open-data","slug":"new-certificates-launched-help-everyone-discover-understand-and-use-open-data","title":"New certificates launched to help everyone discover, understand, and use open data","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:51:32+00:00","created_at":"2013-06-14T22:40:44+00:00","tag_ids":["news"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/5-star-open-data-certificates-tim-berners-lee.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/5-star-open-data-certificates-tim-berners-lee","slug":"5-star-open-data-certificates-tim-berners-lee","title":"Comparing the 5-star scheme with Open Data Certificates","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:59:40+00:00","created_at":"2015-02-20T17:03:04+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","open-data-certificates","open-data","linked-data","tim-berners-lee","5-star-scheme"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Patrice John-Baptiste","slug":"patrice-johnbaptiste","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/patrice-johnbaptiste","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme","team-member"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-data-could-improve-rail-travel-for-disabled-passengers-say-industry-and-passenger-groups.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/open-data-could-improve-rail-travel-for-disabled-passengers-say-industry-and-passenger-groups","slug":"open-data-could-improve-rail-travel-for-disabled-passengers-say-industry-and-passenger-groups","title":"Open data could improve rail travel for disabled passengers’ say industry and passenger groups","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:59:27+00:00","created_at":"2015-01-15T15:55:30+00:00","tag_ids":["news","open-data","office-of-rail-regulation","disability"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/open-data.json","web_url":null,"title":"open data","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=open-data","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/open-data","slug":"open-data"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/office-of-rail-regulation.json","web_url":null,"title":"office of rail regulation","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=office-of-rail-regulation","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/office-of-rail-regulation","slug":"office-of-rail-regulation"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/disability.json","web_url":null,"title":"disability","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=disability","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/disability","slug":"disability"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>Open data could improve rail travel for disabled passengers’ say industry and passenger groups</p>","excerpt":"Last Autumn, rail users and industry leaders joined a workshop at the Open Data Institute (ODI) to explore how open data can improve the development and provision of disabled access to the UK rail network.

It was led by the <a href=\"http://orr.gov.uk/\">Office for Rail Regulation</a> (ORR).</h3>\n<p>Ahead of Disabled Access Day (tomorrow, 17th January 2015), a new paper <strong><a href=\"http://theodi.org/improving-access-to-rail-information-for-disabled-passengers\">'Improving access to rail information for disabled passengers'</a></strong> has been published today. It draws on the workshop discussion and puts forward a set of suggestions to help rail companies and developers improve their services for rail passengers with disabilities.</p>\n<p>The workshop attendees agreed that better rail services for disabled passengers is a win-win for all concerned. There are about <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/family-resources-survey-201112\">11 million people</a> living in the UK with a limiting long-term illness, impairment or disability, with a collective spending power of an estimated <a href=\"http://www.businessdisabilityforum.org.uk/customer-experience/the-evidence\">£80bn per year</a>. Given that 1 in 5 people now use data-driven services and applications in the UK, there is great potential to boost revenue as well as passenger satisfaction by providing access to rail data openly, so useful applications can be built around passengers. </p>\n<p>When transport data is made available, it can be used to make applications that help people plan their journeys and get from A to B in the most efficient way possible. For example, data made available by <a href=\"https://www.tfl.gov.uk/\">Transport for London</a>, <a href=\"www.google.co.uk\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/\">Apple</a>, <a href=\"https://foursquare.com/\">Foursquare</a>, <a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/\">OpenStreetMap</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cyclestreets.net/\">Cyclestreets</a> and <a href=\"http://forecast.io/\">Forecast.io</a> is used by the travel app <a href=\"https://citymapper.com/london\">CityMapper</a> to help people plan their journeys better. This helps consumers to pick solutions that suit their lifestyles or more specific needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>\n<p>People with physical, sensory or cognitive impairments face many transport challenges: platforms can be hard to negotiate and announcements can be hard to see or hear. When disruptions happen to train journeys, it can be difficult for those with disabilities to become aware of the nature of the disruption and alter their journeys accordingly. In emergency situations, it is disproportionately stressful for disabled passengers, who can find it difficult to make themselves known to rail staff or emergency services, hear or see announcements or physically move themselves away from harm.</p>\n<p>Passenger Assist, which allows those with disabilities to book ahead and secure help with their journey has had a limited impact on disabled travellers. A survey conducted by the ORR suggests that user satisfaction with Passenger Assist is reasonably strong, but awareness of it is low. Additionally each rail company operates its own Passenger Assist system and their quality is variable: using the service to arrange assistance for a journey from Plymouth to Aberdeen, in one go, is simply impossible. </p>\n<p><strong>Progress so far</strong></p>\n<p>Developers are already creating applications that turn data about train times, accessibility and facilities at stations into information that’s easy to access for those with disabilities. There are many existing applications that are useful for people with disabilities to help plan their journeys, including Twitter, <a href=\"http://www.stationmasterapp.com/\">Station Master</a> (comprehensive 3D maps that show steps, lift access and ticket points of London Underground stations), <a href=\"http://www.railpoint.co.uk/\">Rail Point</a> (live travel updates) and <a href=\"http://www.realtimetrains.co.uk/\">Realtime Trains</a> (help users track their trains and find their platforms in advance).</p>\n<p>So what is stopping more products and services from being developed to benefit commuters with disabilities?</p>\n<p>Well, solutions like the ones above depend on data being up-to-date and open for others to re-use, which is currently a problem. There is no one truly open, unrestricted source of real-time train data, and the ones that do exist can be expensive and often come with licensing conditions. Data about rail stations, their facilities and accessible infrastructure is largely not open or dynamic, and there is no consistent process for keeping it up-to-date. Given that applications can be expensive to create, as well as buy, those with disabilities may not be able to access to the applications created for them.</p>\n<p><strong>The paper makes five suggestions for rail companies and developers:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Recognise the potential value in disabled customers</strong></p>\n<p>People with disabilities make up a substantial market, which, if engaged properly, could offer rail companies a significant potential revenue stream.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Make rail services and information accessible for all groups, not just disabled people</strong></p>\n<p>It should be a priority of all rail companies and stations to guide people through busy routes as quickly as possible, so updates and information should be easy to see or hear for everyone.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Open more data, and offer incentives to developers who can help fill gaps in services with applications</strong></p>\n<p>Opening more data is a positive step towards finding solutions to grant better access to the railways for disabled customers. Once data is open, startups and developers can use it to build applications that improve understanding of and access to services.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Ask people with disabilities what they need</strong></p>\n<p>It is crucial to scope the usefulness of services and information applications with their intended users early on, so they are fit for purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Collaborate on ventures</strong></p>\n<p>A joint venture between independent developers and the rail industry would help both move towards a common objective and understand each other’s needs and capacities much better.</p>\n<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>\n<p>The workshop highlighted a wealth of information, ideas, and willing organisations which could help to use data to improve travel by rail. It showed that much of this thinking is currently fragmented and disparate but demonstrated the great potential of collaboration, when passengers, developers and industry leaders are brought together to jointly consider solutions with a common aim. </p>\n<p>ORR is planning to build on the workshop by holding a hackathon for developers and interested organisations and individuals in 2015. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Do you have any comments, suggestions or ideas?

The report explores how open data could help customers to compare and analyse their banking data to ensure they are receiving the best deal for their money. Only 2-3% of bank consumers in the UK currently switch their accounts to an alternative banking institution. </p>\n<p>If UK banks were to adopt the open data recommendations set out in the report, more consumers would have access to information about banks before joining them, and would therefore not be burdened by the cost of switching providers.</p>\n<p>Jeni Tennison, Technical Director at the ODI believes the report will help to deliver a more transparent and accessible relationship between UK banks and their consumers.</p>\n<p>“We are excited by the prospect of the HM Treasury exploring the recommendations we delivered. Consumers can only benefit from being able to access their own banking information via APIs.”</p>\n<p>Early next year, HM Treasury will launch a call for evidence to explore how the recommendations can be adopted and delivered by UK banks to ensure openness in their transactions with their customers.  </p>\n<p><em>Download the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-sharing-and-open-data-for-banks\" title=\"full report\">full report</a> for more.</em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/guest-blog-data-catalyst-growth.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/guest-blog-data-catalyst-growth","slug":"guest-blog-data-catalyst-growth","title":"Guest Blog: Data as a Catalyst for Growth","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:50:43+00:00","created_at":"2012-12-02T21:15:02+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-data-enshrined-mexico-constitution.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/open-data-enshrined-mexico-constitution","slug":"open-data-enshrined-mexico-constitution","title":"Mexico enshrines open data into its federal regulation","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-04-20T16:25:06+00:00","created_at":"2015-02-20T14:08:00+00:00","tag_ids":["page","news","mexico","open-data","leaders-network"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/page.json","web_url":null,"title":"Page","details":{"description":"Page","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=page","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/page","slug":"page"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/mexico.json","web_url":null,"title":"Mexico","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=mexico","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/mexico","slug":"mexico"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/open-data.json","web_url":null,"title":"open data","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=open-data","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/open-data","slug":"open-data"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/leaders-network.json","web_url":null,"title":"leaders network","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=leaders-network","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/leaders-network","slug":"leaders-network"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>The government of Mexico has today <a href=\"http://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5382838&fecha=20/02/2015\" title=\"mandated\">mandated</a> that open data is the default for all public communication that it produces.</p>","excerpt":"The government of Mexico has today [mandated](http://www.dof.gob.mx/notadetalle.php?codigo=5382838&fecha=20/02/2015 \"mandated\") that open data is the default for all public communication that it produces.\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"News: Open data progress","url":"","content":"<p>The government of Mexico has today <a href=\"http://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5382838&fecha=20/02/2015\" title=\"mandated\">mandated</a> that open data is the default for all public communication that it produces.</p>\n<p>The news comes on the concluding day of the <a href=\"http://theodi.org/news/national-leaders-create-global-network-open-data-impact\" title=\"Open Data Leaders Network\">Open Data Leaders Network</a>, held at the ODI headquarters in London.

CarbonCulture members use open data to reduce their direct costs, demonstrate their leadership to others. And they share the benefits among a community of leaders like Number 10 Downing St, DECC and Defra.

They have to persuade officials, politicians and even the general public that open data is an idea worth pursuing.</p>\n<p>Being an open data leader should not be a siloed role. This is the foundation statement of the <a href=\"https://theodi.org/open-data-leaders-network\">Open Data Leaders Network</a>. Last week, the ODLN collaborated with the <a href=\"http://www.eurasia.undp.org/\">United Nations Development Programme</a> to gather government innovators in Istanbul, with the purpose of exchanging best practices, knowledge and challenges in open data, across the Eurasian region. Seven new innovators with fresh ideas joined the ODLN family, representing Kosovo, Albania, Kyrgyzstan, Macedonia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. </p>\n<p>Constructive partnerships in open data are rare, which makes the leaders’ participation in the ODLN all the more important. The network is a unique, creative space for open data innovators, who are provided with concrete impetus to address open data challenges and reforms at municipal, national and regional levels of governance. </p>\n<p>Across Eurasia, resistance from officials to open data reform can pose a challenge for open data leaders, which is all the more incentive for the leaders to learn from each other as champions in the region. </p>\n<p><strong>Overcoming open data challenges and making it a Eurasian priority</strong></p>\n<p>The workshop in Istanbul kicked off with a discussion about open data challenges encountered in the Balkan region. The participant from the municipality of Gjakova, Kosovo realised that open data could increase transparency in governance and prompted city government to construct a portal for making administrative services open. He found it reassuring to see other leaders from the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Balkans faced with the same problems. If open data challenges in Ukraine also exist in Macedonia and in Kosovo, then the best minds in open data surely can generate solutions and positive impact through the ODLN.</p>\n<p>A recurrent theme during the two days was the urgent need to rethink open data as a top priority in Eurasia. In the environment of the ODLN, leaders freely play with ideas about making data sound like more than a game for technical experts. Their task is to change public discourse by advocating that open data is not a public good, rather a free service that citizens have a right to. While this may sound like a truism, the process of treating open data as an official commitment to the public is frequently postponed. Once departments actively choose to publish datasets, they increase their accountability and instil trust. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/63/af/5763af381f986a1311000005/istanbul.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img text-center\" id=\"5763af381f986a07bf000051\"><br />\n<small>The ODLN collaborated with the United Nations Development Programme to gather Eurasian government innovators to share best practices, knowledge and challenges in open data. Credit: The ODI.</small></p>\n<p><strong>Learning from open data success stories</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the realisation is slow to come about in Eurasian public institutions. ODLN participants lament the key difficulties they have encountered when processing and updating datasets. Kyrgyzstan’s participant, who is also an elected MP, highlighted her issue with centralised laws, which prohibit the implementation of a digital innovation process. Her country’s troubled political context witnessed <a href=\"http://thediplomat.com/2015/04/remembering-kyrgyzstans-revolutions/\">two revolutions</a> before 2010, which transformed the request for fair elections into a policy priority. The leader advocated open data as the obvious method to verify an electoral outcome. This led to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrgyzstani_parliamentary_election,_2015\">biometric elections in Kyrgyzstan</a> in 2015, which fostered unprecedented trust in the parliament as a legislative institution. Her success story kicked off the ODI session on successful open data projects worldwide.</p>\n<p>As ODI trainers spoke of <a href=\"https://theodi.org/blog/a-year-in-open-data-how-the-odi-helped-to-deliver-a-successful-democratic-transition-in-burkina-faso\">open elections in Burkina Faso</a> and highlighted the efficiency of <a href=\"http://index.okfn.org/place/brazil/procurement/\">open procurement in Brazil</a>, leaders realised that the success story of Kyrgyzstan was not an isolated example. Open data is a modern tool, empowering citizens to demand transparency worldwide. The practical value of the network is to help leaders make open data friends, both within and outside of government. They engage with scenarios of open data in simulated geopolitical contexts, which may well apply to their future challenges at home. They are encouraged to think outside of the box and to apply open data instruments such as the <a href=\"http://opendatabarometer.org/\">Open Data Barometer</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/\">Open Government Partnership</a>, in order to solve their countries’ issues. </p>\n<p><strong>Leveraging regional efforts to embed open data into government processes</strong></p>\n<p>Though open data can resolve a chain of systemic problems, the implementation of concrete commitments to national reform remains subject to political will. The collision between policy and practice was highlighted by the Ukrainian participant, who called for transparency in government, especially during the unstable years that followed the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Ukrainian_revolution\">Euromaidan revolution</a>. In the absence of a national strategy that prioritises open data, senior officials should, at least, be persuaded of its importance. As ODLN leaders step from the shoes of open data experts into those of open data game changers, they commit to leveraging regional efforts to mainstream open data in governmental processes. </p>\n<p>If social and political lessons fall short of incentive, open data innovators are quick to recognise systems of open procurement and budget tracking as requirements for economic growth. No country will turn down a solid investment opportunity. This makes open data a powerful economic tool. In fact, governments in Eurasia already have open procurement systems in place; across Albania and Kosovo, civil servants contribute to budgetary changes, while in Macedonia and Ukraine, citizens highlight inaccuracies to the relevant departments. These are marks of a healthy culture, where open data is accessible to leaders and citizens alike. </p>\n<p>What exactly did the regional ODLN teach our leaders? If we aim for long-lasting change in government policy, then we must reach out to civil servants who embrace innovation. Being made welcome into a family of regional open data champions, participants are now able to resort to peer-to-peer support, in a joint effort to change government paradigm in Eurasia. </p>\n<p><strong><em>If you have ideas or experience in open data that you'd like to share, <a href=\"mailto:production@theodi.org\">pitch us a blog</a> or tweet us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/odihq\">@ODIHQ</a>.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Flavia Munteanu is an <a href=\"http://theodi.org/team/flavia-munteanu\">Advisory Intern</a> at the ODI.

relatively new policy area like open data can be daunting. While sharing experiences with other leaders in different contexts can help, even more useful is joining a network for long-term peer-learning and engagement.</p>\n<p>The ODI has today published a <a href=\"http://theodi.org/method-report-how-to-create-and-sustain-peer-networks-for-open-data-leaders\">method report</a> to help organisations, researchers and global development practitioners create successful peer networks that support leaders implementing open data initiatives, whether in the private or public sector. </p>\n<p>The report explores peer networks, their key features and what makes them most effective. It also raises ongoing challenges, such as how to sustain a network beyond the initial engagement stages. It forms one in a series produced by the ODI as part of the <a href=\"http://od4d.com/\">Open Data for Development Network</a>, supported by a grant from the <a href=\"http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Pages/default.aspx\">International Development Research Centre</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"peernetworksatoolforhighlevelreform\">Peer networks: a tool for high-level reform</h3>\n<p>The report finds that peer networks have great potential to support open data practice and facilitate high-level reform. People who participate in peer networks often feel more empowered, having boosted their social capital and learned new skills. Successful peer networks have a clear shared vision and formalised governance structure over time. </p>\n<h3 id=\"whatmakesasuccessfulpeernetwork\">What makes a successful peer network</h3>\n<p>Drawing lessons from a body of literature and peer network evaluations, the report offers recommendations for organisations or practitioners interested in convening peer networks to support open data leadership.</p>\n<p>Key recommendations include promoting <strong>‘network thinking’</strong> around participants, and helping them to build relationships through <strong>face-to-face and virtual engagement</strong>. Also important to network success is a focus on being flexible enough to <strong>meet external opportunities and adapt to the needs of network members</strong> – which may shift. </p>\n<p>The report finds that successful networks generally have a highly <strong>motivated convenor</strong> who attracts resources, mobilises members and engages new participants. They also use <strong>platforms that enable members to self-organise</strong>, engage and take ownership over actions. </p>\n<p>The report also recommends that network credibility and influence can be bolstered with <strong>high-quality research and outputs</strong>, produced by members, along with stories, tools, resources and guides. Finally, the report suggests that network success in the long-term depends on ongoing <strong>monitoring and evaluation</strong> of network outputs and outcomes, with input from members, so that approaches can be adapted where necessary.</p>\n<p><strong><em>If you have insights into open data and network building that you would like to share, we want to hear from you.

I’m looking forward to meeting colleagues from across the world, and to demonstrating the important role the ODI is playing in creating an open data culture that will benefit us all”.</p>\n<p>The US visit marks the start of a busy autumn schedule at the ODI which also includes <a href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/\">our first Summit</a> on October 29th</p>","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-data-startups-100k-odine.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/open-data-startups-100k-odine","slug":"open-data-startups-100k-odine","title":"Open data startups get a €100k boost ","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-14T07:58:00+00:00","created_at":"2015-09-07T14:30:43+00:00","tag_ids":["news","open-data","odine","startups"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/open-data.json","web_url":null,"title":"open data","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=open-data","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/open-data","slug":"open-data"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/odine.json","web_url":null,"title":"odine","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=odine","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/odine","slug":"odine"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/startups.json","web_url":null,"title":"startups","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=startups","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/startups","slug":"startups"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>Open Data Incubator for Europe funds seven startups to innovate with open data, with wide outcomes from tackling infectious diseases to publishing commodity prices</p>","excerpt":"Open Data Incubator for Europe funds seven startups to innovate with open data, with wide outcomes from tackling infectious diseases to publishing commodity prices\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"Open data startups get a €100k boost ","url":"","content":"<p><em>Open Data Incubator for Europe funds seven startups to innovate with open data, with wide outcomes from tackling infectious diseases to publishing commodity prices</em></p>\n<p>Seven businesses from across Europe will receive up to €100k EU grant funding after being selected as the first round of winners in a new programme: <a href=\"https://opendataincubator.eu/\">Open Data Incubator for Europe (ODINE)</a>.

(OGP) Africa Regional Meeting 2016</a>. The two-day event brings together a wide range of delegates from African governments and civil society, startups and international organisations. It offers a platform to share lessons from programmes across the continent, with a particular focus on promoting sustainable development. </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about\">OGP</a> aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption and harness new technologies to strengthen governance. Members subscribe to the principles of the <a href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about/open-government-declaration\">Open Government Declaration</a> and develop individual action plans to help achieve them in their regions.</p>\n<p>The initiative launched in 2011 with eight members. Five years on, it now has 69. Seven African countries have joined so far: Kenya, Sierra Leone and Tunisia in the first cycle; Tanzania, Ghana, Liberia and South Africa in the second. Malawi and Cote D’Ivoire are currently developing action plans. </p>\n<p>Two ODI team members, <a href=\"http://theodi.org/team/jack-hardinges\">Jack Hardinges</a> and <a href=\"http://theodi.org/search?q=kateryna\">Kateryna Onyiliogwu</a>, are at the event to share the <a href=\"http://theodi.org/method-report-lessons-on-supporting-public-sector-open-data-leadership\">ODI’s experience supporting open data initiatives</a> and meet with ODI Members, colleagues and partners from around the world. </p>\n<p>\"It is clear that the value of the Open Government Partnership is in bringing different actors together, from the governments themselves to those who use the open data they publish to create things that directly benefit citizens,\" says Jack. \"When these actors work together – with responsive government and deep civil society engagement – it gives birth to the progress we have learned more about over the past two days.\" </p>\n<h3 id=\"openinnovationisgainingmomentumacrossafrica\">Open innovation is gaining momentum across Africa</h3>\n<p>Governments across Africa are increasingly recognising the benefits that embracing open data and open innovation can bring. Many African countries have open data initiatives while the latest <a href=\"http://theodi.org/news/open-data-barometer-the-odi-publishes-key-research-as-challenger-initiatives-gather-speed\">Open Data Barometer (OBD) research</a> shows improvements in government transparency and accountability. <a href=\"http://opendataforafrica.org/\">Open Data for Africa</a> is a hub for access to over 50 national data portals.</p>\n<p>Through its work in Africa, the ODI is supporting this growing movement. In Tanzania, for example, we are helping to establish the Dar Open Data Lab (D-Lab), an innovation hub in Dar es-Salaam. D-Lab – a collaboration between <a href=\"http://www.sbc4d.com/\">SBC4D</a>, the University of Dar es Salaam, IntraHealth International and the ODI – will provide a space dedicated to open innovation and help to connect government initiatives with communities of data users and civil society groups.</p>\n<p>\"With so much excitement around open data in Africa the timing for D-Lab is perfect,\" said Simon Bullmore, Head of Learning at the ODI, following a recent visit to Tanzania for the launch of the project.</p>\n<p>\"A lot of open data innovations are experienced on the Web, but they often start in physical spaces – spaces where people come together, learn from experts and each other, experiment and get support. That’s why we got involved. D-Lab will host ODI courses run by local experts and will also provide access to tools, desk space and community events. D-Lab’s online presence will feature training content in both English and Swahili. Importantly, East Africa’s open data champions will have a new place dedicated to helping them thrive.\"</p>\n<h3 id=\"translatinggovernmentwillintorealworldimpacts\">Translating government will into real-world impacts</h3>\n<p>In providing a forum for interaction about open data, D-Lab follows the establishment of the <a href=\"https://theodi.org/open-data-leaders-network\">Open Data Leaders Network</a> (ODLN) last year – a peer network that enables open data leaders to share challenges and lessons. <a href=\"http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/small-teams-big-ideas-open-data-ambition-runs-startups-governments?hootPostID=004bee84c433ee6bf3acc4892e6c88a2\">ODLN was designed</a> to amplify evidence and ideas from the developing world about creating sustainable open data cultures, in order to allow context-specific solutions to emerge – and the <a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/open-data-leaders-in-government-finally-have-a-support-network-each-other\">evidence from the participants</a> suggests the support is welcome. From Africa, so far Morocco, Burkina Faso, Nigeria and Tanzania are members of the network. </p>\n<p>It is encouraging to see that the ODI’s work with partners in the continent is supporting progress that is being shared and learned from. \"It has been great to hear the successes of Tanzania, <a href=\"https://theodi.org/blog/a-year-in-open-data-how-the-odi-helped-to-deliver-a-successful-democratic-transition-in-burkina-faso\">Burkina Faso</a> and Rwanda described in numerous sessions at the OGP meeting,\" says Kateryna, from the meeting in Cape Town. “It shows the significant impact of the ODI’s work in supporting open data initiatives and developing open data champions in the region.”</p>\n<p>Regardless of their duration or scale, these projects share a common aim: fostering interaction in order to translate government will into progress on the ground. This remains a big challenge in Africa, even for the early adopters. The recent <a href=\"http://opendatabarometer.org/doc/3rdEdition/ODB-3rdEdition-GlobalReport.pdf\">ODB report</a> found that African countries – while demonstrating improvements in supply-side areas – continue to struggle to achieve impact on citizens’ lives through open data initiatives. </p>\n<p>The focus on sustainable development at the OGP Africa meeting is therefore timely. By providing a forum for leaders to discuss how to increase the efficacy of open government projects in addressing the challenges Africa faces, it can act as an impetus. Taking the opportunity to share and learn from lessons will help the continent to keep momentum and pave the way for the <a href=\"http://theodi.org/the-value-of-open-data\">social, economic and environmental benefits</a> that open innovation can bring. </p>\n<p><em><strong>Tom Sasse is Services Intern and Anna Scott is <a href=\"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott\">Writer / Editor</a> at the

Rembrandt to Henry Moore sculptures, these <a href=\"http://theodi.org/open-inheritance-art-bringing-hidden-artworks-into-light\">artworks</a> reside anywhere from stately homes to suburban semis and “together represent one of the largest 'secret' collections in the country”, says historian and broadcaster, Dr Hannah Grieg.</p>\n<p>The artworks are made available under Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs’ (HMRC) <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tax-relief-for-national-heritage-assets\">Conditional Exemption Incentive scheme</a>. It aims to keep national assets of outstanding beauty, historical or scientific interest – such as paintings, rare books, furniture and sculptures – in the UK. In return for tax incentives, owners agree to make the assets available to the public.</p>\n<p>The Open Inheritance Art <a href=\"http://openiart.uk/\">online platform</a> empowers the public to easily discover these national heritage artworks, find their location and arrange viewings with the owners using existing open data – that anyone can access, use and share – about the artworks on its website.</p>\n<p><strong>Improving data about these artworks will increase public engagement</strong></p>\n<p>Open Inheritance Art is designed to improve and enrich HMRC’s data, by allowing people to flag missing or outdated information that can be directly fed back to HMRC. In addition, with the owner’s permission, visitors can photograph and upload digital copies of the works onto the website. In many cases, these photos are the first digital representations of the works, displayed on the website and uploaded to WikiMedia, a freely usable media source under open licences.</p>\n<p>Jo Pugh, founder of Open Inheritance Art, said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>These objects are the work of the world’s greatest artists and craftspeople and we want to bring them closer to the public. We have worked hard to mine the data so we can attempt to highlight where works are made permanently publicly available, in National Trust properties or other stately homes. We're also calling upon art lovers to contact private owners through our website to arrange access and encourage a widescale digitisation of these important cultural assets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Historian and broadcaster Dr Hannah Greig, convenor of the Public History course at York said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Open Inheritance Art promises to be a really exciting resource. There is a huge array of historically significant art currently held in private collections, about which little is known or which were only known through word of mouth hints and personal contacts with the owners. By making information about these private holdings publicly available, Open Inheritance Art promises to transform access to that material. I can't wait to see what treasures will be unlocked and look forward to helping generate public awareness about the material.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jeni Tennison, CEO at the ODI said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The ODI Showcase funds exciting projects that can bring about real impact through innovative use of open data. The more the public uses and contributes to Open Inheritance Art, the more accurate and valuable the data becomes, and the more useful in helping the British public to engage with these artworks. HMRC has acknowledged these assets as culturally significant. It’s great to see open data being used to make them as accessible to the public as they deserve to be.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>About the ODI Showcase</strong></p>\n<p>The ODI Showcase supports projects that demonstrate how open data can be used to bring longstanding benefits to individuals, organisations and society. The ODI provides grant funding, mentoring and promotional support to maximise these impacts.</p>\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"http://theodi.org/open-inheritance-art-bringing-hidden-artworks-into-light\">Read the full Open Inheritance Art story</a></strong></em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Patrice John-Baptiste","slug":"patrice-johnbaptiste","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/patrice-johnbaptiste","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme","team-member"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-inheritance-art-bringing-hidden-artworks-into-light.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/open-inheritance-art-bringing-hidden-artworks-into-light","slug":"open-inheritance-art-bringing-hidden-artworks-into-light","title":"Open Inheritance Art: bringing hidden artworks into light","format":"article","updated_at":"2017-02-17T12:24:40+00:00","created_at":"2017-01-23T13:10:34+00:00","tag_ids":["page","odi-showcase","art","transparency"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-showcase-winners-qa-open-inheritance-art.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-showcase-winners-qa-open-inheritance-art","slug":"odi-showcase-winners-qa-open-inheritance-art","title":"ODI Showcase – winner’s Q&A: Open Inheritance Art","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-09-08T09:46:20+00:00","created_at":"2016-09-07T14:38:56+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","odi-showcase","art"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-showcase-winners-announced-for-our-summer-call.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-showcase-winners-announced-for-our-summer-call","slug":"odi-showcase-winners-announced-for-our-summer-call","title":"ODI Showcase 2016 – winners announced for our summer call","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-09-23T15:48:39+00:00","created_at":"2016-09-05T14:54:48+00:00","tag_ids":["news","odi-showcase","challenge"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Patrice John-Baptiste","slug":"patrice-johnbaptiste","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/patrice-johnbaptiste","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme","team-member"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/opendatasoft-partners-with-odis-north-carolina.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/opendatasoft-partners-with-odis-north-carolina","slug":"opendatasoft-partners-with-odis-north-carolina","title":"ODI startup OpenDataSoft partners with ODI’s North Carolina Node to create Smart Government solutions","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:56:01+00:00","created_at":"2014-08-01T13:28:56+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"Two open data companies from the ODI’s growing network, one French, one American, have today announced they are forging a partnership.

The information that does exist – on results, in particular – has often been confined to PDF documents, hidden away on council websites. It has not always been clear which political party is in even control of which council. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-showcase-2016-out-for-the-count\">Out for the Count</a> is a new campaign calling for <strong>more open and accessible data on local elections</strong> across the UK. It is a project run in partnership between the <a href=\"http://www.lgiu.org.uk/\">Local Government Information Unit</a> (LGiU) and <a href=\"https://democracyclub.org.uk/\">Democracy Club</a>.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-2016-spring-call-for-entries\">funding and support from the ODI</a>, Out for the Count is working to deliver the <strong>UK’s first election results tracker</strong> for the local government elections. This will crowdsource results live from counts taking place across the country as they come in, with the help of volunteer ‘<a href=\"http://www.lgiu.org.uk/what-we-need-from-you-as-a-count-correspondent/\">Count Correspondents</a>’.  </p>\n<p>Out for the Count’s vision is to <strong>help voters get a fast feedback loop</strong>, so if they turn out to the polls they can find out what happened to their vote. This will help to support the broader aim of ensuring <strong>greater transparency in elections, and more informed choices for voters</strong>. In support of open elections around the world, Out for the Count's results tracker is being designed so it can be used again for elections everywhere. </p>\n<h3 id=\"manyhandsmakedemocracywork\">Many hands make democracy work</h3>\n<p>Over the past few weeks, Out for the Count has been <a href=\"http://www.lgiu.org.uk/project/out-for-the-count/\">crowdsourcing</a> data to build a <strong>candidate database</strong>, listing <a href=\"https://whocanivotefor.co.uk/\">information on all candidates</a> ahead of the election. </p>\n<p>This has meant identifying the locations of all the lists of candidates on every council website and asking volunteers to turn what is published in PDFs on council websites into open data. Much of this has been a case of copying and pasting information, with Democracy Club volunteers validating the data retrospectively. Our very own <a href=\"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison\">Jeni Tennison</a> has been one of the most active volunteers in helping to build the candidate database. </p>\n<p>To track the results on Thursday, Count Correspondents will enter results data into the database that Democracy Club use to manage candidates – itself an iteration of <a href=\"https://github.com/mysociety/yournextrepresentative\">mySociety’s YourNextRepresentative platform</a> – via <a href=\"https://candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/\">candidates.democracyclub.org.uk</a>. A <a href=\"https://candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/help/api\">live API</a> will make all this data available to anyone who wants it. </p>\n<p>Appending results data to the existing candidate database will enrich the open elections data that exists, and will allow for historical trends to reveal themselves over time.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"whowillbenefitfromoutforthecountsdatabaseandresultstracker\">Who will benefit from Out for the Count’s database and results tracker?</h3>\n<p>Better information about candidates and elections means <strong>more informed decision making and more accountable representatives</strong> in future. Building the first open dataset of local elections results is a big step forward in <strong>bringing democratic transparency to the digital age</strong>.</p>\n<p>The data gathered by Out for the Count is already being used by different groups to help enrich understanding of the elections. Alongside Democracy Club’s database <a href=\"https://whocanivotefor.co.uk/\">WhoICanVoteFor</a> – which over 10,000 people have already used to date – the data is being used to power the LSE’s <a href=\"http://www.democraticdashboard.com/\">Democratic Dashboard</a>, which aims to promote engagement in the electoral process by making election and constituency information more accessible.</p>\n<p>Out for the Count's candidate database and results tracker will ultimately give voters access to the best possible information on who is running and winning in their areas, while ensuring the democratic process is as open as possible for councillors.</p>\n<p>\"We want to show the value of having timely open data on elections, candidates and results and to encourage local governments to provide this information in machine-readable and discoverable formats, as well as citizen-accessible, human-readable formats,\" says Joe Mitchell, Coordinator of Democracy Club CIC.</p>\n<p>\"We are working with the Cabinet Office, the LGA and others to ensure that we learn lessons from this year, which can be applied to future elections – avoiding the (unnecessary) hard work of copying and pasting elections data to make it accessible to citizens and journalists. Together, our goal is to have all councils publishing data openly and accessibly by the 2020 general and local elections.\"</p>\n<h3 id=\"howcanigetinvolved\">How can I get involved?</h3>\n<p>There’s still time to sign up to be a Count Correspondent and report the results in your area.

This is proof-positive that open is becoming the new normal and we are one step closer to creating a web of data alongside the web of documents that is integral to all our lives. I would urge the world’s largest companies to show leadership in the corporate sector by presenting their information as open data so that we can get access to a \u0002truly transparent view of the world’s corporate networks”.</p>\n<p>Starks and ODI Chairman, Sir Nigel Shadbolt are currently in Aspen, Colorado, taking part in the <a href=\"http://new.livestream.com/aspeninstitute/Focas2013\">Aspen Institute’s Forum on Communications and Society </a>(FOCAS 2013). 35 influential academics, government representatives and public policy experts will discuss transparency tools and approaches to improving the way governments and citizens interact.</p>\n<p>Nigel Shadbolt said:</p>\n<p>“Identifying the extensive, complex, and sometimes opaque connections which exist amongst global corporations is of enormous benefit to society and the economy. By opening up this data, OpenCorporates provide tools that promote transparency, accountability and efficient governance. Companies who believe in ethical trading and honest markets have nothing to fear and much to gain from open data. Understanding their networks will enable governments, businesses and citizens to make better decisions – be they legislative, commercial, ethical or environmental. The tide has already turned towards openness, those who do not turn with it will be left behind.”</p>\n<p>In addition to the corporate network visualisations, OpenCorporates has produced <a href=\"http://opencorporates.com/viz/financial/index.html\">maps </a>which show the world-wide interests of four US banks - Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. They reveal complex and deep networks, as well as the central position that the Cayman Islands have within the networks.</p>\n<p>OpenCorporates hopes the project will encourage companies to improve the accuracy of their reporting and make more information available as open data. \u0002Chief Executive, Chris Taggart said:</p>\n<p>“OpenCorporates new corporate network feature allows everyone access to global corporate networks on the same free and open basis, massively reducing barriers to access this data. It also allows collaboration between data holders, and the wider community to show gaps, errors and inconsistencies in official data.

They focused on a class of drugs called statins, which are used to prevent cardiovascular problems.  </p>\n<p>The current evidence shows that for most patients, all drugs from this class are equally safe and effective, so doctors are usually advised to use the cheapest. The analysis examined how much money was spent in each area on the more expensive drugs. It looks at the entire prescriptions dataset (37 million rows of data), and therefore represents results from facts, not models. If the research had been conducted a year ago, over £200m could have been saved, looking forward the team expect to identify similar potential savings.  </p>\n<p>It found that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>An average £27m a month of potentially unnecessary expenditure on the two proprietary statins took place last year in the NHS in England.</p></li>\n<li><p>This is part of a wider issue of spending on proprietary drugs in cases where good and far cheaper generic equivalents exist. Previous research has estimated that these wider patterns cost the NHS over £1 billion pounds a year in excess spend*.</p></li>\n<li><p>The cost of an individual prescription item can vary from as little as 81p for a generic, to over £20 for drugs still under licence to the pharmaceutical companies that develop\u0002- The set of available drugs is constantly evolving, and the right prescription for each individual is very personal. The analysis doesn't suggest that all the prescribing costs identified\u0002are “waste” but a clear public overview of the data can make it easier for doctors, patients, politicians, the NHS and the public to identify potential savings.</p>\n<p>The initial data analysis is available through a new online portal called<a href=\"http://www.prescribinganalytics.com/\"> Prescribing Analytics</a>, which is open to everyone - but particularly to support health care professionals and managers with responsibility for prescribing drugs and controlling budgets.  </p>\n<p>Ben Goldacre, the doctor and writer behind <a href=\"http://www.badscience.net/\">BadScience.net</a> said:  </p>\n<p>“We have found potentially huge savings for the NHS here, in a project that cost almost nothing to build, by doing one simple analysis on publicly available data. I’m sure doctors and patients will find it useful to see whether they can save NHS money in their area. But the real joy has been working on a project with that combined the skills of geeks and geeky doctors: I hope others will come and do the same!”  </p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Open data value</strong></p>\n<p>Welcoming the findings, Medical Director of the NHS Commissioning Board, Sir Bruce Keogh said:  </p>\n<p>“Variation in prescribing habits costs the NHS millions of pounds a year. Transparent sharing of information will help clinicians understand whether they are over or under prescribing. This will focus minds in a way that will not only improve the quality of treatment for patients but also reduce cost and free up money for re-investment in other parts of the NHS.”  </p>\n<p>The ODI’s Chairman, Nigel Shadbolt said:  </p>\n<p>“This project is an example of how open data can be used to help services run more effectively and efficiently. In using open data to highlight trends, we see where we can do better and make improvements. Inefficiency in any system often results from poor or incomplete information about the overall picture. This is something that open data can address as Prescribing Analytics so dramatically illustrates. The analysis should be required reading for all GPs as they seek to make best use of their resources”.  </p>\n<p><strong>Next steps</strong>  </p>\n<p>One of the drugs in this first phase of work, Atorvastatin, has now come off licence. However, the team working on Prescribing Analytics have identified several more drug categories that they plan to analyse.  </p>\n<p>The ODI has provided business advice and financial support to the team behind the findings. CEO, Gavin Starks said:  </p>\n<p>“This is an exceptional example of Open Data being transformed into knowledge for everyone. It gives patients and GPs the tools they need to help realise big savings for the NHS - which is ultimately value for everyone.  </p>\n<p>The team have done an excellent job designing programmes that make it easy for anyone to use the information to maximise its impact. They have shown an important element of the power of Open Data- raising awareness and helping everyone create interventions that drive change.”</p>\n<p><em>Read\u0002this story in <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21567980-how-scrutiny-freely-available-data-might-save-nhs-money-beggar-thy-neighbour\">The Economist</a></em></p>","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/preserving-data-for-future-generations.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/preserving-data-for-future-generations","slug":"preserving-data-for-future-generations","title":"Preserving data for future generations","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:52:07+00:00","created_at":"2013-10-31T09:07:51+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}}],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>UK’s only copy of the Skor Codex Presented to ODI President, Sir Tim Berners-Le</p>","excerpt":" The UK’s only copy of the Skor Codex presented to ODI President, Sir Tim Berners-Lee\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":" UK’s only copy of the Skor Codex Presented to ODI President, Sir Tim Berners-Le","url":"","content":"<p><strong>The UK’s only copy of the Skor Codex presented to ODI President, Sir Tim Berners-Lee</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3814/10591524863_7219a96ff4.jpg\" alt=\"All rights reserved: Brendan Lea\"></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.brendanlea.com/\">Image by Brendan Lea</a></em></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/culture/skor-codex-2012\" title=\"SKOR Codex\">SKOR Codex</a>, an artwork designed as a lasting symbol of the preservation of cultural data in a non-digital format was presented to ODI Founder Sir Tim Berners-Lee at the <a href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/\" title=\"ODI Summit\">ODI Summit</a> in London on 29th October 2013 by Dutch artists, <a href=\"http://societeanonyme.la\" title=\"La Société Anonyme\">La Société Anonyme</a>.</p>\n<p>The SKOR Codex is one of only eight books in existence designed to last 1000 years.

These could include commercial opportunities for providing services based on the data. For example, apps that help parents find homes close to schools that support the interests of their children, and to help schools to share good practices and facilities.</p>\n<p>The NPD contains data about nursery and school pupils in England dating back to 1995. It holds information on where children and young people live, aspects of their family background and whether they receive free school meals. At the moment, the data can only be shared for research purposes.

There have been cases where developers at hack days have been able to find themselves in datasets like these. Whilst we welcome enabling research into the well-being of children and using this data to inform policy, commercial uses should be supported in other ways”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The ODI has suggested how useful aspects of the NPD could be made available as open data whilst protecting peoples’ privacy by summarising the data in new ways. This would enable the private sector to create services for parents and teachers without generating additional bureaucracy and costs for the Department for Education.</p>\n<p>The ODI’s CEO, Gavin Starks added:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“We see great value from open data, such as the <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/news/prescription-savings-worth-millions-identified-odi-incubated-company\">£200m/year potential saving for the NHS</a> we released last week.

The right data environment will benefit everyone, but we are yet to have a truly open debate about its benefits and risks.</p>\n<p>The internet has connected us in ways we couldn’t have imagined. Countries can respond quickly to its citizens’ needs, businesses target resources and compete in global markets, and communities share ideas.</p>\n<p>Like our transport and energy infrastructures, many groups have convened to create the web of data. Some see data as a new raw material, fuelling economic growth and improved services; others see it as a means of building trust in transparent governments; and some see the impact of the web over the next 25 years dwarfing its impact during the past quarter of a century.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“We need to discuss who owns our data infrastructure, what roles the public and private sectors should have, and what role we as citizens play”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Governments, businesses and communities plan our essential physical infrastructure, and we should treat data as a core asset. As our physical and digital worlds combine, we need to plan our data infrastructure not just for a healthy digital economy, but as part of a healthy country. If we want the UK to be ‘brilliant at the internet’ as Baroness Martha Lane-Fox, co-founder of Lastminute.com, recently called for, we must look at data literacy as part of our future.</p>\n<p>Diverse businesses already use open data from both public and private sectors. Our research recently polled 270 open data businesses in the UK, with a combined turnover of £92 billion and 500,000 employees. Half use open data made open by other businesses. Embracing this culture of sharing, both formally and informally, helps grow sectors and, if harnessed using the power of the web, can enable peer support to influence returns radically for everyone, improving operations, customer interactions, supply chain efficiencies, and the quality of products and services.</p>\n<p>But this is not just about government or business. We need to discuss who owns our data infrastructure, what roles the public and private sectors should have, and what role we as citizens play. How might it be governed and what are the social contracts between each of its users, given that the web is already global and our data is already almost entirely privatised, often by companies outside of our borders?</p>\n<p>Equally, organisations have to be a credible, authoritative and sustainable source of the data they manage. They need to act responsibly and responsively to user-needs, and be transparent about their sources and management. And, organisations that use data must be able to adapt to shifting political, competitive and social contexts. It is far more efficient for organisations to design for open systems first and apply restrictions, than to design closed systems and worry about secure integration later.</p>\n<p>Last month, at the <a href=\"http://opendatacon.org/\">International Open Data Conference</a> in Ottawa, we initiated a <a href=\"http://theodi.org/who-owns-our-data-infrastructure?\">global discussion</a> to prompt governments and organisations to engage in this critical topic.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s time we took our data infrastructure as seriously as our physical infrastructure.</strong></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"Raconteur report: The Data Economy 2015","url":"http://raconteur.net/the-data-economy-2015"}],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/who-owns-our-data-infrastructure.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/who-owns-our-data-infrastructure","slug":"who-owns-our-data-infrastructure","title":"Who owns our data infrastructure?","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-11-18T15:32:13+00:00","created_at":"2015-05-27T11:02:51+00:00","tag_ids":["page","open-data","infrastructure","strategy","visions","international"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/saving-money-and-the-environment-with-open-utility.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/saving-money-and-the-environment-with-open-utility","slug":"saving-money-and-the-environment-with-open-utility","title":"Saving money and the environment with Open Utility","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:57:42+00:00","created_at":"2014-10-30T17:01:19+00:00","tag_ids":["news","open-utility","energy"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/open-utility.json","web_url":null,"title":"Open Utility","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=open-utility","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/open-utility","slug":"open-utility"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/energy.json","web_url":null,"title":"Energy","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=energy","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/energy","slug":"energy"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>Open Utility, a company on the ODI startup programme, whose mission is to create the first renewable electricity marketplace, has secured half a million pounds of funding from the UK Government, the EU and Nominet Trust to deliver its vision.</p>","excerpt":"[Open Utility](https://www.openutility.com/ \"Open Utility\"), a company on the [ODI Startup programme](http://theodi.org/start-ups \"ODI Startup programme\"), whose mission is to create the first renewable electricity marketplace, has secured half a million pounds of funding from the UK Government, the EU and Nominet Trust to deliver its vision.

The programme helps promising start-ups develop cleantech ventures. </p>\n<p>Open Utility is one of 18 companies that have gone through the ODI’s startup programme, which supports new businesses to develop innovative open data ideas into sustainable businesses. The programme supports companies with product development, funding, technology, operational, marketing and financial advice. Five companies have recently graduated the programme with innovative, market-ready products. </p>\n<p>Having launched a comparison service that helps renewable generators find the best rates for selling their export power, the team will now develop an online peer-to-peer energy marketplace, partnering with one of the UK’s many licensed energy companies to build the technology. Following a pilot phase, the service will launch in 2016 offering tools for renewable generators to sell their electricity directly to consumers. In return, consumers will have full transparency over where their power comes from, greater choice, and will be able to source the best deal, obtaining low carbon ‘green’ electricity at the lowest possible price. </p>\n<p>James Johnston, Co-Founder and CEO at Open Utility said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“We think the future is in abundant, clean, local energy - and the only way to make this happen is to throw open the marketplace so there is total transparency of where renewable energy comes from and how much it costs. With our new peer-to-peer service, community buildings like schools and offices will be able to double as power plants - powering themselves during the day and sharing excess power with neighbours in the evenings and weekends.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gavin Starks, CEO at the ODI said: </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Open Utility’s peer-to-peer energy marketplace could have a huge economic and environmental impact. Allowing generators to publish energy data as open data will both drive transparency and unlock open innovation in the sector. It is great to see the power of the open web, combined with crowd-enabling business models, presenting additional solutions to help meet our energy needs.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Amber Rudd, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Energy and Climate Change, said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The UK has a long and rich history of developing innovative and exciting new technologies that can enhance our lives whilst also tackling serious problems such as climate change.

Gavin shared the concept for ‘Smart Streets’ a model that takes metadata and applies it to all commercial spaces within an urban centre, and brings together multiple data series (household income, expenditure and so on) for investors to make better informed business decisions in their cities.</p>\n<p><em>See Gavin’s <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/262464666/Bringing-investment-back-to-urban-centres-Gavin-Chait-Whythawk\" title=\"slides\">slides</a>, watch his <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/125588852\" title=\"presentation\">presentation</a>, and follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GavinChait\" title=\"@GavinChait\">@GavinChait</a> on Twitter.</em></p>\n<p>Finally, <strong>Kevin O’Malley</strong>, Partnership Development Manager of City Innovation at Bristol City Council answered the question of how to scale smart cities with <strong>authorities or similar bodies investing in infrastructure and services, communities growing as they benefit from them and ultimately creating their own data and services</strong>. Kevin used the example of Bristol to show how there is no one-size-fits-all approach to smart cities, and that <strong>citizen engagement is a difficult but vital element of creating a smart city</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>See Kevin’s <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/262464623/Involving-citizens-and-communities-in-the-development-of-smart-cities-Kevin-O-Malley,\" title=\"slides\">slides</a>, watch his <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/125600827\" title=\"presentation\">presentation</a>, and follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BristolCouncil\" title=\"@BristolCouncil\">@BristolCouncil</a> on Twitter.</em></p>\n<p><strong>For more on the ODI’s smart cities vision and sector focus, visit <a href=\"http://theodi.org/smart-cities\" title=\"theodi.org/smart-cities\">theodi.org/smart-cities</a></strong></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"Watch: ODIFutures -

The piece explores the real-time online presence, clicks and selections of this community by manipulating their data, creating rhythms which are translated into abstract sound and visual compositions. As the latest addition to the ODI’s <a href=\"http://theodi.org/culture\">Data as Culture</a> art programme We Need Us asks: </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If data had lives of their own, what would they be doing? </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A 15 minute sequence of 13 different animated compositions will be projected onto the western side of Southbank Centre’s Royal Festival Hall from 4pm till 11pm on Friday 28th, Saturday 29th and Sunday 30th November. </p>\n<p>The new Web We Want Festival is celebrating 25 years of the World Wide Web in partnership with Web pioneer and innovator Sir Tim Berners-Lee’s World Wide Web Foundation. It is a weekend of digital art, events and activities about the web and its 25-year history. </p>\n<p>Julie Freeman, creator of We Need Us and ODI Art Associate, said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We Need Us embraces the core values of the web: real-time connectivity, the action of the crowd, the ability to share and help each other, and the transformation of personal action into global experience. By projecting the work onto the Royal Festival Hall for the Web We Want Festival we give everyone the chance to encounter it. Digital street art for all!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gavin Starks, CEO of the ODI, said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We Need Us explores the relationship between humans, nature, science, and the web. Being able to experience We Need Us, a digital artwork, outdoors brings together our physical and digital lives. Public perception of the “data spectrum” is that everything from wikileaks to GCHQ to bus timetables occupy a similar space. We urgently need a public conversation about the role of data in society, its risks and its benefits. Our Data As Culture programme is designed to help stimulate this debate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ruth Mackenzie, Director of The Space, said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Exploring our joint values and determination to encourage exciting new work, <strong>We Need Us</strong> is the first piece from an exciting partnership with the ODI – a champion for the openness of data and the freedom of expression for artists, and all of us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://webwewant.southbankcentre.co.uk/\">Web We Want Festival</a> is taking place over three weekends:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>27 – 28 September 2014</li>\n<li>28 – 30 November 2014</li>\n<li>29 – 31 May 2015</li>\n</ul>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/we-need-us-artwork-launches-at-ted-global.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/we-need-us-artwork-launches-at-ted-global","slug":"we-need-us-artwork-launches-at-ted-global","title":"'We Need Us' artwork launches at TED Global ","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:57:17+00:00","created_at":"2014-10-06T19:23:53+00:00","tag_ids":["news","data-as-culture"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/data-as-culture-2014.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/data-as-culture-2014","slug":"data-as-culture-2014","title":"Data as Culture 2014","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:55:10+00:00","created_at":"2014-03-19T11:49:57+00:00","tag_ids":["page","culture"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/what-is-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/what-is-open-data","slug":"what-is-open-data","title":"What is open data?","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-01-05T15:22:05+00:00","created_at":"2014-10-30T15:43:18+00:00","tag_ids":["page","open-data","explained","what-is","introduction","closed-data","shared-data"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/friday-lunchtime-lecture-making-music-with-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures/friday-lunchtime-lecture-making-music-with-open-data","slug":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-making-music-with-open-data","title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: Making music with open data","format":"event","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:57:23+00:00","created_at":"2014-09-29T12:42:03+00:00","tag_ids":["odifridays-lunchtime","lecture","music","leeds","event:lunchtime-lecture"],"extras":{"start_date":"2014-10-10T12:00:00+00:00","end_date":"2014-10-10T12:40:00+00:00","location":"The Open Data Institute, 65 Clifton Street, London, EC2A 4JE"}}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/seven-new-startups-join-the-odis-incubation-programme.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/seven-new-startups-join-the-odis-incubation-programme","slug":"seven-new-startups-join-the-odis-incubation-programme","title":"Seven new companies  join the ODI’s startup programme","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:56:02+00:00","created_at":"2014-06-26T14:31:51+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"Seven new businesses join the ODI’s startup programme","url":"","content":"<p>Seven new open data startups have today (27th June) joined the ODI startup programme from a diverse range of industry backgrounds:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.icanmake.co/\">I Can Make</a> creates kits for parents and teachers to use 3D printers with children.

There is currently no data on the number of calls made by deaf people to 999, which means that call patterns are being missed, and there are no statistics for how long it takes to answer a 999 call from a deaf caller. We create that data and make it open, delivering realtime geo-mapping of incidents, and offering a direct link between callers and blue light services, improving the experience for deaf people contacting 999 in an emergency.\"</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/skills-route-allows-students-a-glimpse-into-the-future-thanks-to-open-data-innovation.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/skills-route-allows-students-a-glimpse-into-the-future-thanks-to-open-data-innovation","slug":"skills-route-allows-students-a-glimpse-into-the-future-thanks-to-open-data-innovation","title":"Skills Route gives students data-driven careers advice","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:58:27+00:00","created_at":"2014-12-01T11:15:16+00:00","tag_ids":["news","skills-route","odcs","event:open-data-challenge-series"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/skills-route.json","web_url":null,"title":"Skills Route","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=skills-route","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/skills-route","slug":"skills-route"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/odcs.json","web_url":null,"title":"ODCS","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=odcs","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/odcs","slug":"odcs"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/events/event%3Aopen-data-challenge-series.json","web_url":null,"title":"Open Data Challenge Series","details":{"description":"Open Data Challenge Series","type":"event"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?event=event%3Aopen-data-challenge-series","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/event%3Aopen-data-challenge-series","slug":"event:open-data-challenge-series"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>Skills Route is an innovative online tool for young people and their parents, which combines students’ GCSE grades and open data on the performance of nearby schools and colleges, to project their performance on A-Level or vocational courses. </p>","excerpt":"<img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/ac/05/54ac05fbf362be08c8000007/skillsroute.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"54ac05fb1f986a3fb6000020\">\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"","url":"","content":"<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/ac/05/54ac05fbf362be08c8000007/skillsroute.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"54ac05fb1f986a3fb6000020\"></p>\n<p><strong>Winner: <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/project/open-data-challenge-series/Education-Open-Data-Challenge\" title=\"Open Data Education Challenge\">Open Data Education Challenge</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.skillsroute.com/\">Skills Route</a> is an innovative online tool for young people and their parents, which combines students’ GCSE grades with open data on the performance of nearby schools and colleges, to project their performance on A-Level or vocational courses. The tool also shows students what university and career options would be open to them, along with the sort of salary they can expect.</p>\n<p>The tool is designed to increase awareness of the full range of educational options that are available after GCSEs, and to ensure each young person makes the best possible choices for themselves. As Steve Preston, CEO and founder of MIME Consulting, the company behind Skills Route explains:</p>\n<p>“40,000 Year 12 students drop out of school each year, often because they start a course that isn’t appropriate for them. We developed Skills Route to provide young people with an engaging way of finding out about the options available to them post-16, and of understanding the implications of their choices on university and career options, as well as their future earning potential.”</p>\n<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>\n<p>Skills Route is designed to provide information on the most appropriate institutions in the local area where students can take A-Levels, vocational courses and apprenticeships. This is based on their subject preferences, their postcode and GCSE grades (predicted or actual). It also shows students the grades they are likely to achieve at various schools and colleges, based on the performance of previous students at that educational institution who had the same prior grades, and hence the value it adds to an individual’s academic performance. Importantly, Skills Route combines the chosen subjects and projected grades in order to demonstrate personalised university, further education and employment options available in the future. It helps young people and their families make the choices that are best suited to their educational needs and that are linked to their future aspirations. Skills Route is currently in its beta phase, having received positive feedback from the young people who have already tried it. </p>\n<p>Mark Weatherhead, Vice principal from <a href=\"http://www.ernestbevin.org.uk/\">Ernest Bevin College</a>, London, whose students looked at an early version of the service said: </p>\n<p>“Skills Route is remarkably intuitive and comprehensive. The link to careers advice is a real plus. This is going to be really good for young people.” </p>\n<p><strong>The data</strong></p>\n<p>Skills Route shows how using open data can help create innovative solutions for important societal issues. The online tool is based on Level 3 value-added (L3VA) data, published by the Department for Education, which captures the progression of students between Key Stage 4 (years 10 and 11) and the end of their Level 3 qualification (A-Levels and vocational equivalents). L3VA is a complex dataset showing not only the overall progress of students, but also the impact of schools and teachers in the educational journey. It is a key dataset used by Ofsted and has been published as open data for some time, yet it requires specific expertise for people to use it in meaningful ways. Skills Route also uses open data on higher education and apprenticeship providers to show students a wider range of further and higher education opportunities.</p>\n<p>Skills Route brings these datasets together for the first time, linking subjects, courses, jobs and salaries, a successful example of innovation with social impact.</p>\n<p><strong>The bigger picture</strong></p>\n<p>Skills Route showcases how products and services based on open data can help people to make important decisions by providing insights into the performance of social institutions such as schools and colleges.</p>\n<p>Skills Route establishes a direct link between the quality of services offered by educational providers and a student’s likely post-16 qualification  outcomes and future salaries. Young people and their families can now base their choices on solid data instead of word-of-mouth. This will promote greater accountability amongst educational providers and has the potential to stir greater competition in education which could lead to better services in the future.</p>\n<p><em>Find out more about the Open Data Education Challenge <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/project/open-data-challenge-series/Education-Open-Data-Challenge\" title=\"here\">here</a>, and more on the ongoing Open Data Challenge Series <a href=\"http://theodi.org/opendatachallengeseries\" title=\"here\">here</a>.</em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/sound-and-music-call-open.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/sound-and-music-call-open","slug":"sound-and-music-call-open","title":"ODI Data as Culture programme opens residency call with Sound and Music","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-10-29T16:06:37+00:00","created_at":"2015-10-27T13:40:50+00:00","tag_ids":["news","data-as-culture","sound-and-music","artist-residency"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/data-as-culture.json","web_url":null,"title":"data as culture","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=data-as-culture","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/data-as-culture","slug":"data-as-culture"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/sound-and-music.json","web_url":null,"title":"sound and music","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=sound-and-music","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/sound-and-music","slug":"sound-and-music"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/artist-residency.json","web_url":null,"title":"artist residency","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=artist-residency","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/artist-residency","slug":"artist-residency"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>The ODI and Sound and Music announce an opportunity for artists to test their composition skills, writing new music inspired by open data.</p>","excerpt":"ODI Data as Culture and Sound and Music open calls for sound artist residency\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"","url":"","content":"<h3 id=\"odidataascultureandsoundandmusicopencallsforsoundartistresidency\">ODI Data as Culture and Sound and Music open calls for sound artist residency</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/2f/8b/562f8b23d0d46207bb000001/culture-300.png\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img pull-right\" id=\"562f8b23f362be088400001d\"></p>\n<p><em>Today, the ODI and Sound and Music have announced an opportunity for artists to test their composition skills, writing new music inspired by open data, and for a collaborative dance company.</em></p>\n<p>Aimed at talented composers and creative artists, Embedded is Sound and Music’s bespoke professional development programme that gives composers the chance to work with established arts organisations, providing practical hands-on experience as well as fostering long-term creative relationships.</p>\n<p>Partnering with the Open Data Institute for the first time, this round of <a href=\"http://www.soundandmusic.org/\">Sound and Music’s</a> <a href=\"http://www.soundandmusic.org/projects/embedded\">Embedded programme</a> will see one data-driven artist spend nine months working closely with ODI experts, curators and networks.</p>\n<p>Taking inspiration from open data, the selected composer will produce a unique new composition for the ODI's Data as Culture programme. The work and its resultant exhibition or performance will join the programme’s arts projects that explore the intrinsic qualities of data, interpret how data may look, feel or sound, and apply novel uses of data beyond known applications.</p>\n<p>Founded by Sirs Tim Berners-Lee and Nigel Shadbolt in 2012, the ODI and its Data as Culture programme are committed to supporting artists to create new works that may improve conceptual understandings of data and where it can lead society. The composer will have the opportunity to immerse themselves in this culture, producing a unique sonic work to exhibit at the ODI HQ in Shoreditch and at the 2016 ODI Summit.</p>\n<p><strong>Hannah Redler, ODI Associate Curator in Residence said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The embedded composer will be Data as Culture’s first ODI Artist in Residence whose primary focus is sound. The partnership with Sound and Music allows us to raise questions about what the increasing volume of data tracking, informing, surrounding and defining us might begin to sound like. I can't wait to see what the selected composer comes up with. I'm very much looking forward to welcoming them to the ODI team.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can find out more about the application process [here](\nhttp://www.soundandmusic.org/projects/applications-open-embedded-open-data-institute).</p>\n<p><strong>Compose for dance with Sounding Motion!</strong></p>\n<p>Up to three composers will be selected as part of Sound and Music’s <a href=\"http://www.soundandmusic.org/projects/call-portfolio-sounding-motion\">Portfolio programme</a> to develop small-scale works for dance with Sounding Motion.  </p>\n<p>Sounding Motion is a collaborative company consisting of musicians (viola/ percussion) dancers, and a choreographer. The selected composers will have the opportunity to develop their collaborative skills and creative practice in workshops as they work in close partnership with instrumentalists, choreographer and dancers to develop a new short dance work for presentation by the company in late 2016. </p>\n<p>Sound and Music’s Portfolio scheme provides a key development opportunity for composers to create new work with and for some of the UK’s leading ensembles and presenters of new music. Portfolio enables them to develop their portfolio of compositions and gain vital artistic and practical insight and experience in working with professional ensembles and presenting organisations, and delivering new work to public audiences.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.soundandmusic.org/projects/call-portfolio-sounding-motion\">Find out more here.</a></p>","media_enquiries_name":"Patrice John-Baptiste","media_enquiries_email":"patrice.jb@theodi.org","media_enquiries_telephone":"+44 (0) 7931 387 769","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Patrice John-Baptiste","slug":"patrice-johnbaptiste","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/patrice-johnbaptiste","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme","team-member"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/culture.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/culture","slug":"culture","title":"Data as Culture","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-08-19T11:02:10+00:00","created_at":"2012-11-25T22:02:06+00:00","tag_ids":["page","data-as-culture","culture","art","data-driven"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Patrice John-Baptiste","slug":"patrice-johnbaptiste","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/patrice-johnbaptiste","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme","team-member"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/south-east-asias-first-open-data-startup-accelerator-launches-with-help-from-the-odi.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/south-east-asias-first-open-data-startup-accelerator-launches-with-help-from-the-odi","slug":"south-east-asias-first-open-data-startup-accelerator-launches-with-help-from-the-odi","title":"South East Asia’s first Open Data Startup Accelerator launches with help from the ODI   ","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-10-15T13:55:17+00:00","created_at":"2015-10-15T11:51:55+00:00","tag_ids":["news","startups","malaysia","south-east-asia"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/startups.json","web_url":null,"title":"startups","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=startups","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/startups","slug":"startups"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/malaysia.json","web_url":null,"title":"Malaysia","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=malaysia","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/malaysia","slug":"malaysia"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/south-east-asia.json","web_url":null,"title":"South East Asia","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=south-east-asia","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/south-east-asia","slug":"south-east-asia"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>The Malaysian government today (15 October) launched the first Open Data Startup Accelerator in South East Asia, the first startup accelerator supported by the ODI outside of Europe. </p>","excerpt":"The Malaysian government today (15 October) launched the first Open Data Startup Accelerator in South East Asia, the first startup accelerator supported by the ODI outside of Europe. \r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"South East Asia’s first Open Data Startup Accelerator launches with help from the ODI   ","url":"","content":"<p>The Malaysian government today (15 October) launched the first Open Data Startup Accelerator in South East Asia, the first startup accelerator supported by the ODI outside of Europe. </p>\n<p>Entry onto the programme will be open to startups from Malaysia who are using open data or publishing their own data to create innovative new products and services.</p>\n<p>Over the coming months the Open Data Institute will advise the Malaysian government on setting up the incubator, help them to select the startups from an open competition and offer strategic advice during the programme.

We now urge government to consider data as infrastructure that is fundamental for delivering digital transformation, growing the economy and realising cost reductions.</p>\n<p>The government’s spending review includes a commitment to improve digital innovation in the public sector, but as many sectors and countries have seen, the potential benefits go far beyond public sector efficiencies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dataisinfrastructure\">Data is infrastructure</h3>\n<p>Data is infrastructure, and is vital for the operation of modern society. It underpins transparency, accountability, public services, business innovation and civil society. Data such as statistics, maps and real-time sensor readings help us to make decisions, build services and gain insight. The data that government publishes could be used across all of society as open data – by companies, charities and citizens – to build better services, gain new insights and generate economic growth. </p>\n<p>For example, the UK Government committed to giving every individual and small business a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hmtreasury/status/669498737551646720\">digital tax account by 2020</a>. Together with the work being developed by the <a href=\"http://theodi.org/news/open-banking-working-group-uk-experts-impact-consumers-regulators-industry\">Open Banking Working Group</a>, this will enable people and businesses to access their bank transactions, switch accounts and pay their tax from within a banking app. These initiatives will help lay the data infrastructure foundations for the digital economy in the financial sector.</p>\n<h3 id=\"thecaseforopenness\">The case for openness</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@ODIHQ/the-economic-impact-of-open-data-what-do-we-already-know-1a119c1958a0#.2lr2n4kuh\">The economic case for open data</a> is strong and will only get stronger as more companies and sectors go open. The cities, countries and even continents that build the most robust and open data infrastructure will have an enormous advantage in the 21st century economy. The UK has been a world leader in the digital economy, we now need to accelerate to continue that leadership.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bringingbenefitstoeveryone\">Bringing benefits to everyone</h3>\n<p>When our roads, railway and energy networks were being built we learnt how to maintain them for the good of everyone. We need to do the same for data infrastructure. It is vital for the operation of our society and economy.</p>\n<p>We look forward to the government’s Digital Transformation plan that will be published in early 2016 and hope that it seizes this opportunity to strengthen the UK’s data infrastructure.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Jeni Tennison is <a href=\"https://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison\">Technical Director & Deputy CEO</a> at the ODI.

We are working to adopt the standard in all our work, and look forward to being able to publish a set of UK contract data in the new year.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Chris Taggart, CEO of <a href=\"http://theodi.org/start-ups/opencorporates\">Open Corporates</a>, a UK company that provides open data about 84m companies worldwide, and a graduate of the ODI startup programme, said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The Open Contracting Standard may sound like an esoteric and irrelevant government project but by making procurement information as standardized open data it has the potential to help fight corruption, improve government services, fostering innovation, as well as making it much easier for citizens to see where their money goes.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As part of the announcement the Open Contracting Partnership are inviting governments <a href=\"http://standard.open-contracting.org/\">to access the Standard</a> and adopt the tools to ensure contracting is transparent and efficient, and citizens and NGOs are urged to monitor and analyse published data.</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/survey-shows-majority-uk-public-servants-recognise-importance-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/survey-shows-majority-uk-public-servants-recognise-importance-open-data","slug":"survey-shows-majority-uk-public-servants-recognise-importance-open-data","title":"Survey shows majority of UK public servants recognise importance of open data","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:52:25+00:00","created_at":"2013-02-18T15:10:14+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}}],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"excerpt":"The first survey on the use of open data by government has found that the majority of public servants agree that understanding how to access, share and use data will be increasingly important over the next three years. \u0002Even though most of those surveyed by Listpoint didn’t fully grasp government policies or the benefits of open data, more than half agreed that ready access to data and data standards will generate new enterprises, jobs and services.","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"content":"<p>The first survey on the use of open data by government has found that the majority of public servants agree that understanding how to access, share and use data will be increasingly important over the next three years. \u0002Even though most of those surveyed by Listpoint didn’t fully grasp government policies or the benefits of open data, more than half agreed that ready access to data and data standards will generate new enterprises, jobs and services.</p>\n<p>Key findings of the survey include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>78% do not know about government plans for open data and the benefits that follow</li>\n<li>An overwhelming 72% recognised that knowing how to access, share and use data will be increasingly important over the next three years</li>\n<li>52% recognised that ready access to data and data standards will generate new enterprises, jobs and services in the public and private sectors</li>\n<li>57% do not know how to access data sets, how to interpret them or how to best apply data standards</li>\n<li>More than 75% do not know what data is available outside their department to help develop new solutions for service delivery</li>\n<li>66% said they did not understand their role in delivering the open data agenda</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Commenting on the findings, the ODI’s Technical Director, Jeni Tennison said:</p>\n<p>\"This is an interesting survey of the attitudes towards and understanding of data in general and open data in particular, across the public sector.

Over half of ODI members are from outside the technology and data sectors, with notable clusters emerging in smart cities, higher education and healthcare.</p>\n<p>Research conducted by ODI Startups Spend Network and OpenCorporates shows that our members turned over £8bn in the last year, using Companies House and Government spending open data. For example, <a href=\"https://directory.theodi.org/members/ON9682OI\" title=\"Dialogue by Design\">Dialogue by Design</a> has valuable <a href=\"https://spendnetwork.com/transaction_detail/DFT004_DFT_gov/DFT004_DFT_gov_2013_04_3997\" title=\"contracts\">contracts</a> with the Department for Transport, where it analyses data from public consultations, and <a href=\"https://directory.theodi.org/members/FU6239DL\" title=\"The Audience Agency\">The Audience Agency</a> is regularly <a href=\"https://spendnetwork.com/supplier_spend/08117915_com\" title=\"commissioned\">commissioned</a> to conduct market research for councils.</p>\n<p>Gavin Starks, ODI CEO reflects: “Reaching our first 100 member milestone in 18 months demonstrates that there is substantial commercial interest in the emerging open data ecosystem. As we expand the ODI Global Network over the coming years, we expect to see more great collaborations, partnerships and open innovation emerging between big companies, startups, universities, and others across every sector.”</p>\n<p>“We’re delighted to see such growth in the ODI member network,” says ODI Head of Commercial Partnerships Georgia Phillips. “It reflects how businesses are starting to recognise and explore the opportunities open data can bring. ODI membership was created to enable organisations to connect more easily with one another around the shared cause of open data. It’s exciting to see them flourish and inspire each other to unlock the potential of open data by using it to drive innovation, efficiencies and reputation. They are always looking for faster, leaner ways of finding, managing and analysing data, and are communicating the value back to their respective sectors. We encourage new organisations to join up as ODI members and see what’s possible for open data in their own work.”</p>\n<p><strong>Collaboration and ideas exchange</strong></p>\n<p>The membership network has seen many collaborations and a steady flow of ideas exchange in its 18 months. For example, ODI Supporters Flying Binary and CloverETL came together to pitch for a project on G Cloud worth £80,000. Jacqui Taylor, Founder and CEO of FlyingBinary, said: “We were looking for corporate partners with open source ETL expertise which is quite a niche field. At the same time CloverETL were looking for companies with open data domain expertise to collaborate on an open data project. How to make that happen? Use the ODI member directory. We're now working together on an £80,000 open data project, which will be launching soon. The directory is a fantastic starting point for companies exploring the potential of open data.”</p>\n<p>Two ODI members Arup and Mastodon C are now working together in partnership within the digital built environment, with Mastodon C's team being hosted in Arup offices in London. Fran Bennett, CEO of Mastodon C, said \"the ODI member network has been a great way to forge new business relationships through their events and online community.\" Mastodon C is also working with ODI Supporter Dialogue by Design, \"combining its expertise in machine learning with Dialogue by Design's understanding of consultation design and qualitative data analysis to make it faster and easier for their clients in the public, private and third sector to gain insight into consultation responses. This will complement Dialogue by Design's existing bespoke consultation services.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Setting the bar high in data publishing</strong></p>\n<p>ODI Supporter GeoLytix has recently published <a href=\"http://geolytix.co.uk/blog/\" title=\"supermarket location data\">supermarket location data</a> openly for supermarkets across the UK, which is the first time the data has been published in one place. The new open dataset enables supermarkets to see where the next commercial opportunity might be, and has many potential benefits for consumers. GeoLytix says: “Our ultimate vision is that retailers and the public grab hold of this dataset, and we enrich and improve it. For example, we could add in features – fish counter, electrical department, pharmacy, accessibility and so on – the possibilities are endless.”</p>\n<p><strong>Creating new products and services</strong></p>\n<p>ODI Supporter Lokku now produce <a href=\"http://www.splash-maps.com/\" title=\"SplashMaps\">SplashMaps</a>, waterproof maps for hikers, adventurers and tourists.

networking opportunities. “Membership of the ODI has created educational, networking and potential partnership opportunities whilst at the same time serving to underscore our commitment to adding meaningful public access to open data,” says Hugh Brookes, CoreFiling. </p>\n<p>And membership has inspired others to improve their own work and processes. “Open data and our ODI membership has made us reexamine the way we collect data in our business” says Stuart Chalmers from BRE. “We now think of how we, and others, can benefit from reusing and exploiting our data in new, innovative and

UK</a>, setting out steps the next UK Government can take to harness the benefits of open data for improved policy making and social, environmental and economic benefit. </p>\n<p>The launch of the roadmap coincides with a joint Institute for Government/Open Data Institute event, <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/events/open-data-and-transparency\" title=\"Open Data and Transparency\">Open Data and Transparency</a>, from 12:30pm today (Thursday 11 December). </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/ministers-open-floodgates-to-release-official-data-9916725.html\" title=\"The Independent today reports\">The Independent today reports</a> that Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude will, in his speech at today's event, commit the government and local councils to go much further and \"open floodgates to release official data.\"</p>\n<p>The UK is currently ranked no. 1 in the world for its open data leadership (<a href=\"http://www.opendataresearch.org/dl/odb2013/Open-Data-Barometer-2013-Global-Report.pdf\" title=\"Open Data Barometer 2013\">Open Data Barometer 2013</a>). </p>\n<p>The open data roadmap syntheses a range of discussions within the ODI team, with its startups and members, and with members of the UK open data community on how to keep moving forward on open data. It sets out nine recommendations for the UK to continue to build on its open data successes.</p>\n<p>Some of the recommendations include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adopting an ‘all of government’ data strategy that brings together all aspects of data policy in one place in the Cabinet Office </li>\n<li>Creating a new Chief Data Officer to develop, advocate and progress all aspects of this strategy</li>\n<li>Building data publication into everything the Government Digital Service does, </li>\n<li>Empowering trading funds to release more open data, including Companies House, Ordnance survey, Met Office and the Land Registry </li>\n<li>Investing more in data training for government, business and citizens </li>\n<li>Mandating that public procurement contracts require the release of open data, in line with the UK’s commitment under the G8 Open Data Charter to ‘open by default’</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some recommendations come from discussions about building an open data roadmap in the past four months; others have been suggested by different stakeholders over the UK’s open data journey. Some echo recent proposals by the UK Government, which we support, like appointing a government Chief Data Officer. The roadmap sees the UK <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/382552/Efficiency_and_reform_in_the_next_Parliament.pdf\" title=\"Chief Data Officer\">Chief Data Officer</a> as having a crucial strategic leadership role overseeing the UK’s whole of data strategy. </p>\n<p>There is a lot more detail on how the UK Government could improve open data publication, what datasets need to be open, what data training might look like, that the ODI will expand on in the coming months. </p>\n<p>We welcome feedback from the open data community on the open data roadmap and how it can best be followed by government.

The appointments support the ODI's growing commitment to working with practising artists who respond to open data as a subject and material, and can create works that build an understanding of the role of data in culture.</p>\n<p>The residencies will explore the implications of an emerging open data ecosystem, including social interactions, habits and future behavioural trends. In addition to exhibition space, the ODI is providing the residents with unprecedented access to its expert staff and associates, in-depth open data training, a residency fee and a space to develop and further invest in their ideas. </p>\n<p>Hannah Redler, Associate Curator in Residence at the ODI said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Data as Culture art programme is defined by a commitment to open data culture. I’m very excited about working with Thomson &amp; Craighead and Natasha Caruana to imagine and speculate on the many questions the ODI’s work raises. Artists are renowned for their ability to critically unearth new perspectives of emerging cultural and social spaces and its meaning to communities and individuals. I’m expecting to have lots of fun, be challenged, provoked and pleasingly surprised by the works produced, as we open the ODI to the critical minds of some of the UK’s most exciting artists.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thomson &amp; Craighead’s residency will begin in February and run to June 2015. Caruana’s residency will begin in July and end in December 2015. The artists’ existing works will be exhibited at the ODI and their free solo exhibitions will be open to all.</p>\n<p>Thomson &amp; Craighead said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We’re looking forward to working as embedded artists at the ODI and exploring its multifaceted work and research. Much of our own artwork to date looks at what it means to aggregate and interconnect large bodies of information, while considering how mechanisms like the World Wide Web alter, extend and distort our understanding of the world around us. The ODI offers a fertile environment for us to learn so much more about this, and we can’t wait to see what can come of the time we spend there.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Natasha Caruana comments:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My art practice to date has always dabbled with data, looking at statistics of love and infidelity. To be given this opportunity, as Artist in Residence at the ODI will push my previous pseudo-analysis head-first into the world of data. I’m very excited to create a new body of work supported by the ODI and to see what appears from playing with the enormous possibilities of everyday statistics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The overarching theme of the Data as Culture 3 season is <strong>“Data Anthropologies”</strong>. It critically positions humans at the centre of emerging data landscapes, as a collection of innovative artistic explorations from emerging, mid-career and established artists utilising open data as art materials. <strong>It will be launched formally in late March.</strong></p>\n<p>Today’s announcement follows two successful years of Data as Culture, including exhibitions by artists that explore the role of data in our lives. Thomson &amp; Craighead and Natasha Caruana’s existing works will feature in the series this year as part of their residencies.

The OBWG <a href=\"http://theodi.org/news/open-banking-working-group-roster-report-announced\">convened in 2015</a> at the request of HM Treasury to explore how data could help people to save, borrow, lend and invest their money in better ways.</p>\n<p>Implementing the Open Banking Standard framework could significantly accelerate the implementation of new EU regulations on banking data. It would also place the UK in a strong position to lead the development of a similar international standard.</p>\n<p>In its <a href=\"http://theodi.org/open-banking-standard\">report</a>, published today, the OBWG recommends that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>bank data, including information about banks’ products and services, should be made available as <strong>open data</strong>, so that services can be built allowing customers to get more out of their financial relationships (for example, through product comparison services);</li>\n<li>open APIs should be created to enable services to be built using bank and customer data. These would include open data about products and services as well as <strong>shared data</strong> about bank transactions that individuals or businesses can <strong>choose to share</strong> themselves through secure and controlled means.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Today’s report makes it clear that in order to implement these innovations and enable customers, banks and regulators to take advantage of the connected digital economy, a framework will be needed to ensure that <strong>data is secure and the way in which it might be shared is actively governed</strong> – the <strong>Open Banking Standard</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Customer benefits</strong></p>\n<p>The largest predicted benefits of the Open Banking Standard will come when consumers are able to compare banking products and services that have been purposefully tailored to suit their individual needs. For example, it’s estimated that switching overdraft facilities could save people an average of £140 a year.* Today’s report suggests that if consumers could give an approved price comparison service <strong>explicit and limited permission</strong> to access their bank account data across an open API, they could simply and quickly find the best option to suit their needs.  </p>\n<p>Businesses could also benefit. Many SMEs use commercial software for bookkeeping but generally have to add their transaction data manually (or pay a third party to get this information on their behalf). An API from their banking service provider would make it considerably easier to reconcile payments and so provide far more up-to-date financial positions. All a business owner would need to do is log into their accounting system, select relevant bank accounts and give their permission for their data to be shared with their accounting provider, as an approved supplier.</p>\n<p><strong>UK leadership</strong></p>\n<p>In today’s report, the OBWG sets out recommendations for implementing the Standard, and evolving and rolling out the framework over the next five years. These will be carried out by an <strong>Open Banking Implementation Entity</strong>, which will also plan, design and deliver future phases of the Open Banking Standard.</p>\n<p><strong>Co-chair of the OBWG and Barclays’ Head of Client and Customer Experience (Personal and Corporate Banking), Matt Hammerstein said</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Banking as a service has long sat at the heart of our economy. In our digitally enabled world, the need to seamlessly and efficiently connect different economic agents who are buying and selling goods and services, is critical. The Open Banking Standard is a framework for making banking data work better: for customers for businesses and for the economy as a whole.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Fellow OBWG co-chair and ODI CEO Gavin Starks said</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The work of the OBWG and the Open Banking Standard demonstrate the powerful result of leaders coming together to wrestle substantial challenges facing the banking sector. I have been impressed by both the speed and depth with which the group has created a detailed framework and continued leadership in this area will set UK banking apart. It will also set precedents across many sectors: a <strong>strong data infrastructure</strong> will be as important to the UK’s economy today as roads have been to our success in the industrial economy for over a century.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Responding to today’s report, UK Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Harriett Baldwin said</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“I am determined to ensure that our financial services remain at the forefront of technological innovation. That’s why I asked the Open Banking Working Group to explore how an open standard for Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) – or an Open Banking Standard – could be designed to increase competition in Britain’s banking sector, give customers more control over their finances, and provide FinTechs with a globally unrivalled opportunity for innovation in the UK. I welcome the findings published by the Open Banking Working Group today, which encourage the use of APIs and open data in order to benefit customers and businesses. We look forward to continuing to work with industry over the coming weeks to establish how these recommendations will be taken forward. With FinTech week later this month we are on-track to cement the UK’s position as the FinTech capital of the world.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>\n<p>A minimum viable product for an Open Banking API based on open data is recommended to be launched towards the end of 2016, with personal customer transaction data included on a read-only basis starting at the beginning of 2017. The Open Banking Standard’s full scope, including business, customer and transactional data, should be reached by 2019.</p>\n<p><strong>For definitions of key terms in this article, and a summary of

href=\"http://theodi.org/roadmap-uk-2015\">ODI roadmap</a> calls for bold open data action ahead of General Election</h3>\n<p>The ODI is today (11th December) publishing its ‘<a href=\"http://theodi.org/roadmap-uk-2015\">open data roadmap</a> for the UK’, the same day as public sector and industry leaders gather to discuss the progress of the UK's open data and transparency policy at the Institute for Government. The roadmap sets out nine recommendations for the next government, which harness the benefits of open data for improved policy making, and social and economic benefit. In particular, it calls for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>A new government data strategy</strong> that brings together all aspects of data policy in one place in the Cabinet Office </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>The creation of a new Chief Data Officer</strong> to develop, advocate and progress all aspects of this strategy</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Empowered trading funds to release more open data</strong>, including Companies House, Ordnance survey, Met Office and the Land Registry </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Greater investment in data training</strong> for government, business and citizens</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>A mandate that public procurement contracts require the release of open data</strong>, in line with the UK’s commitment under the G8 Open Data Charter to ‘open by default’</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The UK government has made good progress in releasing and reusing government data over the last decade, and is ranked No.1 in the world for its open data leadership <a href=\"http://www.opendataresearch.org/dl/odb2013/Open-Data-Barometer-2013-Global-Report.pdf\">(Open Data Barometer 2013)</a>. But the roadmap is clear that more needs to be done in order for open data to support and enable the UK to address its biggest challenges, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Preparing UK cities for the next 7 million people</strong> - UK cities need to continue to opening up data for new apps and innovations, to help plan and improve infrastructure. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Making UK public services more efficient</strong> - The UK’s ageing and increasing population will put new pressures on its healthcare system and economy over the next 15 years - open data can help identify savings and efficiencies. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Adjusting services to an unpredictable climate</strong> - Rising temperatures will mean more extreme weather for the UK - the 2014 UK floods highlighted the need for better communication in emergency prevention and response. Open data is being used around the world to help target responses to natural disasters. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Boosting the economy by shaping new businesses</strong> - Startups supported by the ODI have used open data to build businesses around government procurement, health savings, smart cities, energy efficiency, 3D-printing and supporting disabled communities. Since 2012, the ODI’s startup programme has attracted £2.5m of income, with clients including government departments, domestic and international businesses. </p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The nine recommendations in the roadmap are:</p>\n<p><strong>Continue to build a coherent open data strategy</strong></p>\n<p>The central government has stimulated a range of activities around open data. Now is the time to connect and focus them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clearly embed open data within a wider data strategy</li>\n<li>Appoint a Chief Data Officer for government to oversee this data strategy</li>\n<li>Build data publication into everything the Government Digital Service does </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Open up more socially and economically beneficial data</strong> </p>\n<p>The UK Government has published a lot of open data, but it still holds important datasets that are ‘closed’. These datasets could have significant social and economic benefits if released as high-quality open data. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support UK trading funds to release more closed datasets as open data </li>\n<li>Use the National Information Infrastructure as a tool to plan for future releases </li>\n<li>Include the release of open data in public procurement contracts</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Support even more reuse of open data</strong></p>\n<p>Across the UK, businesses, researchers, citizens and public bodies already rely on open data to deliver products and services and help lower costs, often without realising. With a clear UK data strategy, the number of businesses, research projects, innovative services and new ways of interpreting open data will continue to flourish. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Commit to data training for government, business and citizens</li>\n<li>Incentivise government to consume open data, not just publish it</li>\n<li>Connect research and development frameworks to open data</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Professor Sir Nigel Shadbolt, Chairman and Co-Founder of the ODI said:</strong></p>\n<p>\"Open data is the raw material for open innovation. In open innovation anyone can find the value in open data. We have seen individuals, start ups, SMEs, FTSE 100 companies, local and national government all create value from open data. Our open data roadmap explains what has to be done to keep the UK world-leading in this area. It requires continued commitment at the highest levels of government. It needs business to make more of both the government and its own open data. It needs an information infrastructure that contains the best open data to give the UK a digital nervous system fit for the 21st century.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Gavin Starks, CEO at the ODI said:</strong></p>\n<p>“Over the last 10 years the UK has set the bar for open data in government. I believe that the UK Government needs to step up its efforts to publish quality data, to help the emerging data supply-chains, and catalyse smart ecosystems. To do so will aid in addressing challenges, both domestically and internationally, to drive innovation, efficiency and transparency. </p>\n<p>“Now is the time to engage business. Across all sectors, we see the development of innovations that improve our travel, our health, our cities, our environment, and create jobs. We see potential efficiencies that could save billions. We see transparency as critical to rebuilding trust. We need the same standards and rigour applied to public data as are applied to commercial data and greater support in catalysing private sector engagement.</p>\n<p>“Without greater commitment, the UK will lose its leading position, and risks missing out on the opportunity to have the UK reap the rewards from the emerging web of data.” </p>\n<p><strong>Jeni Tennison, Technical Director at the ODI, said:</strong></p>\n<p>“At the ODI we want to help unlock data, especially high-value datasets which are key components of our National Information Infrastructure - geospatial data, address data and meteorological data for example - which are often held by public sector trading funds. We want to see government further supporting and empowering the trading funds to open up their data, so that everyone can benefit from it.</p>\n<p>“Currently, there are a series of disparate teams in government managing data policy and delivery. The creation of the Chief Data Officer is essential to join up government’s need for open data and its publication to ensure that data publication is built in to every digital service created by government.”</p>\n<p>The ODI is keen to garner views on the roadmap from government organisations, businesses and the public.

The website uses the Government’s Key Information Set (KIS) and related data sources.</p>\n<p>Which? Executive Director, Richard Lloyd said:</p>\n<p>“Endless pages of data and statistics can be difficult to understand and are overwhelming for consumers: it's not always obvious how it can help them make more informed decisions. We look forward to working with the ODI to understand better how to develop tools that bring open data to life to give consumers greater control and choice over the services they use and fully realise the benefits of greater transparency.”</p>\n<p>Gavin Starks, ODI CEO said:</p>\n<p>“Open data can be transformed into knowledge for everyone. In taking leadership positions, Virgin Media and Which? are demonstrating their commitment to meeting the needs of 21st Century consumers. Like you and I, consumers are increasingly connected and have high expectations of products and services, their convenience, innovation, relevance, privacy, transparency, and support. Using open data can provide credible insight to help organisations provide better services to their customers, and unlock innovation by engaging beyond their in-house capabilities.”</p>\n<p>Professor Nigel Shadbolt, co-founder and Chairman of the ODI, said:</p>\n<p>“These two new relationships signify a key moment for the ODI and demonstrate that open data is crucial to the future success of brands.

We encourage others to join us and discover how open data can generate social, environmental and economic value.”</p>\n<p><strong>The ODI membership programme</strong></p>\n<p>The ODI’s new membership programme has four levels: supporter, member, sponsor and\u0002partner (Virgin Media is a partner, Which? a sponsor). Membership fees start from £540/year for supporters, up to £50,000/year for partners, a proportion may be paid in-kind through the contribution of services, technology or other expertise.\u0002\nMembers receive vouchers that they can redeem against training and other professional services, as well as a 20% discount on future services. Benefits also include access to the growing open data community based at the ODI offices in Shoreditch, London, networking events, and collaboration on projects that create economic, environmental, and social value.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/join-us\">More details are available</a> for those interested in joining the ODI\u0002\n<em><a href=\"http://video.ft.com/v/2236575765001/Start-ups-tap-into-open-data\">See how</a> FT.Com covered the story</em></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/blog/new-industrialists-part-2-open-data-market-makers\">Read a blog </a>by the ODI's Stuart Coleman on the businesses that are making an open data market</em></p>","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/we-need-us-artwork-launches-at-ted-global.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/we-need-us-artwork-launches-at-ted-global","slug":"we-need-us-artwork-launches-at-ted-global","title":"'We Need Us' artwork launches at TED Global ","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:57:17+00:00","created_at":"2014-10-06T19:23:53+00:00","tag_ids":["news","data-as-culture"],"tags":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/news","slug":"news"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/keywords/data-as-culture.json","web_url":null,"title":"data as culture","details":{"type":"keyword"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?keyword=data-as-culture","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tags/data-as-culture","slug":"data-as-culture"}}],"details":{"business_proposition":false,"description":"<p>“If data had lives of their own, what would they be doing?” ODI Art Associate Julie Freeman today launched her new work We Need Us at TED Global in Rio, Brazil. </p>","excerpt":"“If data had lives of their own, what would they be doing?”\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"News - Data As Culture","url":"","content":"<h3 id=\"ifdatahadlivesoftheirownwhatwouldtheybedoing\">“If data had lives of their own, what would they be doing?”</h3>\n<p>ODI Art Associate <a href=\"http://theodi.org/team/julie-freeman\" title=\"Julie Freeman\">Julie Freeman</a> today launched her new work <a href=\"http://www.weneedus.org/\" title=\"**_We Need Us_**\"><strong><em>We Need Us</em></strong></a> at <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/\" title=\"TED Global\">TED Global</a> in Rio, Brazil. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.weneedus.org/\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/32/f8/5432f8d2f362be08bc000008/weneedus__0001_Layer-16.png\" alt=\"WeNeedUs\"></a>\n<small><i>A screenshot from one of the We Need Us projects</i></small></p>\n<p><br><strong><em>We Need Us</em></strong> is a ‘living’ dynamic artwork, powered by people, defined by data-driven unpredictability, exploring both ‘life data’ and the life of data. It’s been co-commissioned by the Open Data Institute and digital art platform The Space, and is the latest addition to the ODI’s acclaimed <a href=\"http://theodi.org/culture\" title=\"Data as Culture\">Data as Culture</a> art programme. The artwork focuses on the intersection between scientific discovery, open data and our human responses to the two, and in doing so reflects the ways in which we humans produce, use and react to the growing amount of data that is available to us.</p>\n<p>“Unlike traditional data visualisation, which helps people understand and make sense of information held in large datasets, <strong><em>We Need Us</em></strong> investigates the unique properties of the data itself,” explains the artwork’s curator Hannah Redler. “The project is something of a thought experiment, which asks: if data had lives of their own, what would they be doing? Julie’s work enables audiences to ‘experience’ data when it would otherwise be invisible and incomprehensible.” </p>\n<p>The artwork uses metadata from citizen science platform <a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/\" title=\"Zooniverse\">Zooniverse</a>, where anyone with a computer can support science projects by classifying data. This includes identifying craters on the moon’s surface from images, classifying tropical cyclone data and analysing images of cancer cells. </p>\n<p>Over a million Zooniverse users classify these datasets. <strong><em>We Need Us</em></strong> explores the online activities of this community by manipulating their metadata: their presence, click and selections from around the world.</p>\n<p>Every minute, the work counts the number of users online and the classifications they create. It stores this in a new database as sets of values, while also recording the frequency of their activity over an hour, a day and a month. These sets of values create rhythms that are translated into moving shapes, and play different sounds. The live data ensures constant change to the visual and sonic composition. The sounds are processed and manipulated just like the data. </p>\n<p>“I wanted to make a work that explores how data can be used that is different to ‘normal’ expectations,” Freeman says. “I chose to use metadata to influence the work instead of choreographing it – I wanted <strong><em>We Need Us</em></strong> to be just outside of my control: to re-animate the data and bring it, through the work, to life.”</p>\n<p>ODI CEO Gavin Starks said, “<strong><em>We Need Us</em></strong> reminds us that the relationship between humans, nature, and now digital technology, is entirely symbiotic. Our world today is driven by data. Our politicians, businesses, institutions and citizens use data far more intensively than we could have imagined – our “data” is doubling every two years. We need us to continuously question this data revolution and the conversation needs to be public. <strong><em>We Need Us</em></strong> adds to our Data as Culture programme, whose aim is to catalyse this debate.”</p>\n<p><strong><em>We Need Us</em></strong> <em>is be available at <a href=\"http://www.WeNeedUs.org\" title=\"WeNeedUs.org\">WeNeedUs.org</a> and at <a href=\"http://www.thespace.org/weneedus\" title=\"The Space\">The Space</a>.

With Sirs Tim Berners-Lee and Nigel Shadbolt she co-founded the Web Science Research Initiative in 2006 and is a Director of the Web Science Trust, which has a global mission to support the development of research, education and thought leadership in web science.</p>\n<p><strong>You have had a long career in the fields of web science and web technology. What first attracted you to the world of the web?</strong></p>\n<p>I became interested in multimedia and hypermedia in the 1980s. We built our own hypermedia system, called Microcosm, at Southampton in the late 80s and presented it at the European Hypertext Conference in Paris in 1990. Also at the conference was one Tim Berners-Lee who was talking about a system he was building that he was yet to call the World Wide Web. I’ve been involved with the world of the web ever since.</p>\n<p><strong>You are an important role model to women, being named as one of the six world-class women of outstanding achievement in science, engineering and technology, and being the first non-US woman to receive the Anita Borg Award for Technical Leadership.  Throughout your career, have you seen progress in terms of opportunities for women in SET?</strong></p>\n<p>No, I see no real progress and in some ways the situation has got even worse considering the time and resource that has been spent trying to “fix” the problem, and the progress that has been made generally to create a level playing field for women in most walks of life. I despair sometimes. On a positive note, I see lots of good examples of very strong women in science and engineering being highlighted in the media, so maybe there is hope.</p>\n<p><strong>What will you be talking about at the ODI Summit?</strong></p>\n<p>The panel I am on is about <a href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/sessions/web-science-technology-open-data-panel/\" title=\"‘The intersection of web science, technology and open data’\">the intersection of web science, technology and open data</a>. The two main points I plan to make are firstly that one of the main drivers for the foundation of web science was to understand the factors underpinning the growth of the web of linked data, and one of those factors is the availability of open data. Conversely, studying the growth of open data and the innovation that results from its availability is a key component of web science. There is also a big component of big data analytics in web science, and I’ll be talking about that as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Which other sessions will you be looking forward to, and why?</strong></p>\n<p>All of them – it is an amazing line up of speakers and topics.</p>\n<p><strong>What direction do you see open data heading in over the next five years, and what most excites you about its future?</strong></p>\n<p>Open data is not an end in itself; it is a means to an end. As more open data becomes available, and more people and companies develop the skills to create innovative projects and applications around the open datasets, we will see things happening that we couldn’t possibly have predicted. It is this unpredictability in the evolution of the web that is both the most exciting and the most challenging thing about it.</p>\n<p><strong>As more councils, cities and countries open up their data, which sector do you think stands to gain the most?</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone!</p>\n<p>Dame Ruth will be a panelist at a discussion on <a href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/sessions/web-science-technology-open-data-panel/\" title=\"‘The intersection of web science, technology and open data’\">‘The intersection of web science, technology and open data’</a> at the ODI Summit Conference at BFI Southbank, London, on Saturday, 4 November.

It is independent, non-profit and non-partisan, founded in 2012 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee and Sir Nigel Shadbolt. The ODI is based in London and its node network operates in 20 countries across six continents</em>.</p>\n<p>We believe data infrastructure is as important as our physical infrastructure and that a well-maintained data infrastructure is needed for the operation of a society. Data infrastructure exists in cities, nations, sectors and globally. It will always include data from across the <a href=\"http://theodi.org/data-spectrum\">closed, shared and open spectrum</a> but the ODI believes that society benefits most when core data assets – such as addresses, weather, property records and mapping data – are published openly. You can read this <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ODIHQ/the-economic-impact-of-open-data-what-do-we-already-know-1a119c1958a0#.xqcgcl539\">summary of the existing economic evidence</a> of the benefits of open data. </p>\n<p>We want to continue understanding the economic case for investment in data infrastructure. </p>\n<p>We also believe in the value of open research: research that is published openly and is open-minded – not only the final output but the data and methodologies underpinning it. We support research that challenges our beliefs just as much as we support research that proves them. </p>\n<p><strong>We wish to commission an independent economic report that looks in more detail at the existing evidence for core data assets. We have a budget of £15,000 (including VAT) for this work. We want to publish the report before the end of February 2016.</strong></p>\n<p>We think that to make the strongest possible case for investment in core data assets we need to be able to answer the following questions. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the expected economic value to a national economy (as a percentage of GDP) from core data assets under two different access models? </li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Paid access - where all organisations must sign a contract, pay a fee and potentially abide by licence restrictions on the purposes that the data can be used for</li>\n<li>Open licence - where anyone can access, use and share the data</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>How will this value accrue across the different parts of the value chain that use the data to deliver products/services to the market? We would suggest the following model for subdividing the value chain but are open to other ideas:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Data publishers</li>\n<li>Aggregators who collect, curate and potentially republish data from multiple data publishers</li>\n<li>Enablers who provide services to facilitate the supply or use of data</li>\n<li>Developers who create applications for individual consumption</li>\n<li>Data users who use data to enhance existing products and services or create new ones</li>\n<li>Service users who use the products and services created by data users</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li><p>What is driving any difference in economic value between the two access models, eg network effects, time saving, allocative efficiency, etc?</p></li>\n<li><p>What are the expected timescales to realise the change in economic value if data is moved between these different access models (for example, from paid to open, or from open to paid)?</p></li>\n<li><p>What steps can be taken to accelerate the change in economic value? </p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If any bidder wishes to propose variations to these questions based on their expertise or on their ability to deliver within the fixed budget and timescale then we are open to their ideas. We will make our assessment based on a mix of price and quality (see detail below).</p>\n<p>The report should draw on the range of evidence that already exists.

It’s set in a town called Sheridan, which is gradually declining as shops close, teachers quit, hedgehogs go extinct and pollution rises. The tools that players build contribute to making Sheridan a healthier, wealthier, happier place to live. </p>\n<p>There’s a short version and a long version of Datopolis. The short version is useful for team workshops and away days – it can be played within 20-30 minutes, and gets people comfortable talking to each other and negotiating to build tools with data. The longer version is for people who really enjoy playing board games – it has added role cards, plenty of bad things happening in Sheridan to contend with, and generally more complexity. </p>\n<p>We’ve been working on Datopolis for almost 18 months now, and have been taken aback by the enthusiasm and energy from people around the world wanting to try it out. </p>\n<p>We’ve been testing our first boxed prototype of Datopolis in the UK at events like Open Data Camp in Bristol, the Cabinet Office and National Audit Office. We’ve also seen people printing and playing Datopolis themselves using the <a href=\"https://github.com/opendataboardgame/game\">components on GitHub</a> around the world, in China, France and New Zealand. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Tested <a href=\"https://twitter.com/datopolis\">@datopolis</a> at SH open data camp today. <a href=\"https://t.co/FUvphgmS0P\">pic.twitter.com/FUvphgmS0P</a></p>— Open Knowledge China (@OKFNCN) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OKFNCN/status/739456410254086145\">June 5, 2016</a></blockquote>\n<p>We’ve used the feedback and suggestions from people playing Datopolis remotely and with us in London to make the game even better. Here’s feedback from one of our playtesters, Lydia Nicholas, Senior Researcher in Collective Intelligence at Nesta. We’ve left in her comments on the game mechanic, to give you a feel of the game:</p>\n<p>Overall everyone was very impressed, particularly with the way the mechanic sets you up to make interesting tradeoffs. It's great that the short version plays so fast because contrasts between games raised a few talking points.</p>\n<p>Our first playthrough was very open; because we played tiles face up and close together there ended up being with very little trading. It was very easy to build any kind of app, except democracy, where the cards turned up late- and then the one yellow tile, laid adjacent to 3 other open tiles prompted a flurry of complex 3-part apps. It felt very like an open, developed marketplace.</p>\n<p>The second time we all initially played our tiles mostly closed, did complicated multilayered deals, and deliberately laid cards in long lines or in ways we knew would be hard for others to reuse- so the our plays naturally skewed towards either stockpiling tiles and laying them all down at once to playing closed systems, or using the very few central, open datasets: everyone made several simple transport apps, regardless of any needs or interests which their other hastily discarded and redrawn cards represented. </p>\n<p>Rather than the second game being a failure, the differences made us all even more interested in the possibilities of the game as a tool for playing through innovation scenarios. We all had fun and loved in particular the naming round being enshrined in the turn order. There were some terrible, very tweetable puns.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whymightibuydatopolis\">Why might I buy Datopolis?</h3>\n<p>We’ve seen Datopolis used for team away days, data events and exhibitions, and to help people communicate the value of data inside their organisations. We also hope it contains enough strategy to be fun for board game lovers too! </p>\n<p>Datopolis is openly licensed, so people can change the game components, introduce new rules, translate it, localise it to their sector or geographic region. Play testers have talked to us about adapting it to explain their own organisation’s sector and potential impact from data. </p>\n<h3 id=\"buyingdatopolis\">Buying Datopolis</h3>\n<p>We’re making Datopolis available for sale for two weeks via <a href=\"https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/datopolis\">Gamecrafter</a>, after lots of people asked how they could get a copy of the prototype. Datopolis (beta) costs $66 USD via <a href=\"https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/datopolis\">Gamecrafter</a> and comes with all the game components you need to get underway, beautifully boxed with cover designs by London-based design consultancy Folk Labs. We haven’t added any margin - this price simply reflects manufacturing costs from <a href=\"https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/datopolis\">Gamecrafter</a>. Unfortunately there’s also fairly pricey shipping fees (GameCrafter is based in the US).</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hey everyone look how lovely <a href=\"https://twitter.com/datopolis\">@datopolis</a>, our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/opendata?src=hash\">#opendata</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/boardgame?src=hash\">#boardgame</a> looks 🙂 cc co-creator <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeniT\">@JeniT</a> + designer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/djwesto\">@djwesto</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/5tC1sFhKG4\">pic.twitter.com/5tC1sFhKG4</a></p>— Ellen Broad (@ellenbroad) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ellenbroad/status/728263344239595520\">May 5, 2016</a></blockquote>\n<p>For an individual, buying Datopolis might be out of reach, but for an organisation or consultant looking for new workshop materials and ways to engage teams around data, it’s a worthwhile investment. If it is too pricey for you, the game components are openly licensed and available from <a href=\"https://github.com/opendataboardgame/game\">GitHub</a> so you can still print and play yourself. </p>\n<p>We don’t know if we’ll produce another boxed version of Datopolis, because we’re not sure what level of interest there is in it yet and so the right way to take it forward. This might be your only chance to own it for yourself!</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatnextfordatopolis\">What next for Datopolis</h3>\n<p>We’ll still be making changes to and improving Datopolis. The hardest part has been creating the instructions, and making the game rules clear and comprehensible for anyone picking up the game for the first time. We still want your feedback in testing out Datopolis. What instructions make sense? What rules would you add? Do you want to make your own version of Datopolis?</p>\n<p>We’d love to see photos and videos of you playing your own copy of Datopolis.

For commuters all across the country, travelling to work often involves multiple stages, meaning a delay at any stage could potentially be amplified as the journey progresses.</p> \n\n    <p>There are now a multitude of apps providing real-time data to help people plan journeys they are about to take. What often isn’t included are indications of a particular service’s reliability based on historic records of punctuality. Such a tool would be just as useful in planning a new journey, or reviewing a regular commute.</p>\n\n    <p>With funding and support from the Open Data Institute, the Fasteroute/Visualising Rail Disruption team built a web application, <a href=\"http://delayexplorer.fasteroute.com/#/\">Delay Explorer</a>, and integrated records of historic punctuality into their app, Fasteroute. With these, users can save significant amounts of time by exploring potential routes and planning journeys by rail using services that are more reliable. They can also avoid risky connections that could be missed due to trains that are often delayed.</p>\n\n    <p>The Fasteroute/Visualising Rail Disruption team are:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>George Goldberg</li>\n      <li>Joe Letts</li>\n      <li>Craig Buchanan</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h3>Analysing the data</h3>\n    <p>The Visualising Rail Disruption team worked with the ODI to analyse aggregated data over 11 weeks, to find how commuters could save time stuck on trains by changing the time they travel. Trains arriving into 16 major commuting hubs across Britain were analysed for their punctuality, by recording any discrepancy between the <i>plan-of-the-day</i> schedule and a service's arrival time. Discrepancies were characterised as being 1–5 minutes late, 5–10 minutes late, 10–15 minutes late, more than 15 minutes late or more than 30 minutes late, considered equivalent to being cancelled. The trends were analysed in half-hour periods throughout the morning between 7am and 10am.</p>\n\n<p>You can find a link to the aggregated data <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SbEiz4yF2U-13jnQJuZ6euFtW6Jjv5UBp-0IuN-C7es/edit#gid=1249510078\">here</a> (Google Sheet). Fasteroute worked with the ODI to find out what the data means for commuters across Britain.</p>\n\n    <p>Categorised into 30-minute time periods between 7am and 10am, the data shows that:</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li><b>Services arriving into cities between 8:30am and 9am are the most unreliable for commuters.</b> An average of two-fifths (42.5%) of train services are delayed or cancelled during this time, causing commuters using these services to endure over 10 hours a year in delays</li>\n      <li><b>More than one-third (35.7%) of all train arrivals between 8:30am and 9am are delayed by between one and 10 minutes</b>, accounting for the most common delay durations</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>Considering all train delays, on average commuters could:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><b>Recover over three and a half hours a year if they travelled an hour earlier</b> (arriving 7:30–8am instead of 8:30–9am), reducing the average chance of delays by a quarter</li>\n      <li><b>Save early risers travelling an hour and a half earlier</b> (arriving 7–7:30am instead of 8:30-9am) <b>over five hours a year</b>, reducing the average chance of delays by half</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Although 1–10 minute delays are considered by the rail industry to be minor disruptions, avoiding such delays will allow commuters to accrue time savings over a year. They are more likely to avoid knock-on impacts, such as missing transport connections, which could result in further delays.</p>\n    <p>The data shows that delays become longer as the morning goes on, which may suggest that earlier delays affect later services. If people were to work more flexible hours, they could reduce their exposure to regular delays. This may also reduce passenger congestion and ease pressure points on the network.</p>\n    <h3>Cities most affected by morning delays</h3>\n    <p>On average, between 7am and 10am, commuters have between a one-in-four chance (24%, 7–7:30am) and two-in-five chance (43%, 8:30–9am) of arriving late. This varies from city to city:</p>    \n    <ol>\n      <li><b>Commuters in Birmingham, Manchester, York, Sheffield and Cardiff</b> are most likely to be delayed on services arriving between 7am and 10am (two in five, 39–45%, of trains are late)</li>\n      <li><b>Commuters arriving into Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow and Cardiff</b> between 8:30am and 9am, the busiest time for train services, are more likely than not (50–52%) to be on a service arriving <b>late rather than on time</b></li>\n      <li><b>Commuters in Exeter, Southampton and Newcastle are the least likely to arrive late</b> with roughly one in four (23–31%) late services</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>The analysis categorises delays as one minute or more after the planned arrival time, which differs to network operators that may classify delays as five minutes for short journeys and 10 minutes for longer journeys.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n      <a href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-visualising-rail-disruption-background\" title=\"Next page\"><img class=\"pull-right\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/16/43/56164300f362be08b400000f/summer_showcase_next_but.svg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n    </div>\n\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"pull-left col-md-3\">\n\n    <div class=\"blog-box-opacity\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-visualising-rail-disruption\">About</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-visualising-rail-disruption-background\">Background</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-visualising-rail-disruption-about-the-data\">About the data</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-visualising-rail-disruption-methodology\">Methodology</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-visualising-rail-disruption-collaboration\">Findings</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-visualising-rail-disruption-what-next\">What next?</a>\n    </div>\n\n  </div>\n</div>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

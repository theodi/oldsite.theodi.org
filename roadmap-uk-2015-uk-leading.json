For more than a decade, UK governments of various political parties have built on the open data initiatives of their predecessors to encourage open data to be released and reused across government: from the launch of the <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/advice/poi/power-of-information-review.pdf\">Power of Information Review</a> by the Blair government in 2007, to the implementation of the <a href=\"http://data.gov.uk/\">data.gov.uk</a> open data portal under the Brown government in 2009, to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/letter-to-government-departments-on-opening-up-data\">David Cameron’s letter to cabinet ministers</a> in 2010, affirming previous progress in open data and setting out the coalition’s transparency agenda.\n</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Among the UK’s many successes have been the publication of more than 15,000 government datasets as open data; the chairing of the inaugural <a href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/\">Open Government Partnership</a> in 2011; the introduction of the <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/\">Open Government Licence</a>; the launch of the Open Data Institute; and frequent training opportunities and incentives for public bodies to release more open data.\n</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/1f/54871f3cd0d46207f0000016/yellow_break.png\">\n    <h4>This means the UK is perfectly placed to unlock value</h4>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The efforts of the Government Digital Service, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Cabinet Office have contributed to the UK’s world-class digital government service delivery.</p>\n    <p><b>There is still more data that can be released, more uses of data that can be demonstrated and more that can be done to improve data quality and literacy.</b></p>\n    <p>The UK has made great strides in open data so far, and must continue to move forward boldly.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/1f/54871f3cd0d46207f0000016/yellow_break.png\">\n    <h4>New businesses are emerging with open data</h4>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>As more open data is released, businesses are using it to grow. Startups supported by the ODI have used open data to build businesses around government procurement, health savings, smart cities, energy efficiency, 3D-printing and supporting disabled communities. They have attracted clients from both the public and private sectors, and, between them, generated £2.5m since 2012.</p>\n    <p>The UK’s efforts in open data have fostered new kinds of innovation and new business models. Now the focus is moving onto sustainability.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/1f/54871f3cd0d46207f0000016/yellow_break.png\">\n    <h4>A sustainable open data culture</h4>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The ODI has been engaging groups from across the UK’s open data communities to gather their feedback and build on this strong foundation. </p>\n    <p>Based on these conversations, the ODI’s roadmap for open data in the UK sets out recommendations for how to achieve a sustainable open data culture. The roadmap also builds on a range of policy documents that have been released this year, including: <a href=\"http://www.statslife.org.uk/images/pdf/rss-data-manifesto-2014.pdf\">the Royal Statistical Society’s Data Manifesto</a>; <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/publications/category/item/technology-manifesto\">Policy Exchange’s Technology Manifesto</a>; and <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/programme-effective-government-1\">the Institute for Government’s Programme for Effective Government</a>.</p>\n    <p>In 2015, the ODI will continue to explore the prerequisites for widespread impact from open data, through discussions with UK stakeholders, technical briefings and regular blog-posts on the ODI website. We will continue to invite feedback as we move from laying the foundations for a sustainable open data culture, to putting it into practice. </p>\n    <p></p>\n    <a href=\"http://theodi.org/roadmap-uk-2015-step1\"><u class=\"pull-right\">next</u></a>\n    <p></p>\n    <img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/1f/54871f3cd0d46207f0000016/yellow_break.png\">\n    <h2>The roadmap</h2>\n    <p></p>\n    <ul class=\"grid effect-2 listing\" id=\"grid2\">\n      <li class=\"home-module\">\n        <div class=\"module-event\">\n          <a href=\"http://theodi.org/roadmap-uk-2015-step1\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/64/548764df1f986a0882000020/1.png\"></a>\n      </li>\n      <li class=\"home-module\">\n        <div class=\"module-event\">\n          <a href=\"http://theodi.org/roadmap-uk-2015-step2\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/66/548766d31f986a0882000022/2.png\"></a>\n        </div>\n     </li>\n     <li class=\"home-module\">\n        <div class=\"module-event\">\n          <a href=\"http://theodi.org/roadmap-uk-2015-step3\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/65/548765afd0d46207f0000031/3.png\"></a>\n        </div>\n     </li>\n   </ul>\n </div>\n</div>\n <div class=\"pull-left col-md-3\">\n    <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document_downloads/249768188?extension=pdf&from=embed&source=embed\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/67/54876771d0d46207f0000037/download.png\" alt=\"\"></a>\n    <p></p>\n    <h3>Roadmap steps</h3>\n    <p></p>\n          <a href=\"http://theodi.org/roadmap-uk-2015-step1\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/68/54876819d0d46207f000003b/step1.png\"></a>\n    <p></p>   \n          <a href=\"http://theodi.org/roadmap-uk-2015-step2\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/67/54876776d0d46207f0000039/step2.png\"></a>\n    <p></p>   \n          <a href=\"http://theodi.org/roadmap-uk-2015-step3\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/68/54876819f362be08ee000031/step3.png\"></a>\n    <p></p>   \n  </div>\n</div>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

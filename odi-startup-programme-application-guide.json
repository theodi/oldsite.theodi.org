Can I apply to both the ODI Startup programme and the Open Data Incubator in Europe?</em> </p>\n<p>Yes. In fact, this is strongly encouraged.</p>\n<p><em>2. Can I meet the startup team to talk about how to apply?</em></p>\n<p>We would be delighted to meet you. However, this may not always be possible, so please send us any questions via email. You might want to come along to a Friday lunchtime lecture or open data meetup and chat with us there. </p>\n<p><em>3. I love the idea of open data, but I'm unsure how my startup fulfils your criteria in that respect.</em></p>\n<p>If you have a strong business model, we can work with you to draw on our open data expertise and explore its potential for your startup.</p>\n<p><em>4. What is your definition of open data?</em></p>\n<p>Open data is data that anyone can access, use and share. Find more in this <a href=\"http://theodi.org/what-is-open-data\" title=\"short video\">short video</a>. </p>\n<p><em>5. Can I use data that is not open data in my proposal?</em></p>\n<p>Yes. The call focuses on open data, but this does not mean that your product cannot use other types of data. In fact, sometimes combining closed and open datasets can bring a lot of benefits.</p>\n<p>A panel of external reviewers will decide if open data plays a central role in your proposal.</p>\n<p><em>6. Do I need to deliver the outcomes of the project as open source or open data?</em></p>\n<p>No, it is not mandatory to deliver your outcomes or enriched datasets as open data. But we strongly encourage you to follow an ‘open by default’ culture.</p>\n<h3 id=\"applynow\">Apply now</h3>\n<p>The application form can be found below and in this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/theodi.org/forms/d/1XcnGtl4buw4UN8HgYgtsyAk5ox0qlPYFs2m_h66ppY8/viewform\">Google doc</a>.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/a/theodi.org/forms/d/1XcnGtl4buw4UN8HgYgtsyAk5ox0qlPYFs2m_h66ppY8/viewform?embedded=true\" width=\"760\" height=\"1200\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading...</iframe>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-startup-programme.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi-startup-programme","slug":"odi-startup-programme","title":"ODI Startup Programme","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-04-01T08:53:26+00:00","created_at":"2015-05-11T13:29:40+00:00","tag_ids":["page","startups","business","incubator"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{}}

Through the ODI we have been inspired to not only use and benefit from open data, but also to communicate about the use of open data to others.</blockquote>\n    <p>— George Goldberg, Fasteroute developer and Project Manager of Visualising Rail Disruption</p>\n    <p></p>\n<h3>Analysing the aggregated data</h3>\n\n    <p>You can find a link to the aggregated data <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SbEiz4yF2U-13jnQJuZ6euFtW6Jjv5UBp-0IuN-C7es/edit#gid=1249510078\">here</a> (Google Sheet). Fasteroute worked with the ODI to find out what the data means for commuters across Britain.</p>\n\n    <p>Categorised into 30-minute time periods between 7am and 10am, the data shows that:</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li><b>Arriving into cities between 8:30am and 9am is the most unreliable time for commuters.</b> An average of two-fifths (42.5%) of train services are delayed or cancelled during this time, causing commuters using these services to endure over 10 hours a year in delays</li>\n      <li><b>More than one-third (35.7%) of all train arrivals between 8:30am and 9am are delayed by between one and 10 minutes</b>, the most common delay duration.</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>Considering all train delays, on average commuters could:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><b>Recover over three and a half hours a year if they travelled an hour earlier</b> (arriving 7:30–8am instead of 8:30–9am), reducing the average chance of delays by a quarter</li>\n      <li><b>Save early risers travelling an hour and a half earlier</b> (arriving 7–7:30am instead of 8:30-9am) <b>over five hours a year</b>, reducing the average chance of delays by half</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Although 1–10 minute delays are considered by the rail industry to be minor disruptions, avoiding such delays will create cumulative time savings and help commuters to avoid negative knock-on effects to journeys, such as missing transport connections, which could result in further delays.</p>\n    <p>The data shows that delays become longer as the morning goes on, which may suggest that earlier delays affect later services. If people were to work more flexible hours, they could reduce their exposure to regular delays. This may also reduce passenger congestion and ease pressure points on the network.</p>\n    <h3>Cities most affected by morning delays</h3>\n    <p>On average between 7am and 10am, commuters have between a one in four chance (24%, 7–7:30am) and two in five chance (43%, 8:30–9am) of arriving late. This varies from city to city:</p>    \n    <ol>\n      <li><b>Commuters in Birmingham, Manchester, York, Sheffield and Cardiff</b> are most likely to be delayed on services arriving between 7–10am (two in five, 39–45%, of trains are late)</li>\n      <li><b>For Commuters arriving into Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow and Cardiff</b> between 8:30am–9am, the busiest time for train services, more than half (50–52%) of trains are likely to arrive late rather than on time</li>\n      <li><b>Commuters in Exeter, Southampton and Newcastle</b> are the least likely to arrive late with roughly one in four (23–31%) late services</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>The Fasteroute data analysis categorises delays as one minute or more after the planned arrival time, which differs to network operators that may classify delays as five minutes or more. The data is collected in real time, giving rail passengers an up-to-the-minute view of train service delays, allowing better-informed travel choices to be made to optimise their journeys on a daily basis.</p>\n    <p><b>Limitations</b></p>\n\n    <p>This data differs from the audited figures released by National Rail, as it shows the data in real-time before it is filtered. For example, National Rail’s audited figures may omit unexpected and unpreventable delays caused during adverse weather conditions. Fasteroute uses the raw real-time data from National Rail’s Darwin Push Port, published under an Open Government Licence.</p>\n\n    <p>National Rail measures against a Plan of the Day, which is the standard timetable with any amendments made for engineering works. This Plan of the Day is also used by Fasteroute when comparing real-time arrival data with the scheduled arrival time.</p> \n    <p>The overall punctuality performance significantly decreases during the most popular commuter arrival destination times of 8:30–9am (average delays were 3min 20s for all cities analysed, weighted by commuting population) and increases the earlier people travel (average delay was only 1min 33s for trains arriving 7–7.30am, for instance).</p>\n\n    <div>\n      <a href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-visualising-rail-disruption-what-next\" title=\"Next page\"><img class=\"pull-right\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/16/43/56164300f362be08b400000f/summer_showcase_next_but.svg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n      <a href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-visualising-rail-disruption-methodology\" title=\"Previous page\"><img class=\"pull-left\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/29/f4/5629f4fe1f986a081e000033/previous.svg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n\n    </div>\n\n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"pull-left col-md-3\">\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-visualising-rail-disruption\">About</a>\n    </div><div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-visualising-rail-disruption-background\">Background</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-visualising-rail-disruption-about-the-data\">About the data</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-visualising-rail-disruption-methodology\">Methodology</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box-opacity\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-visualising-rail-disruption-collaboration\">Collaboration</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-visualising-rail-disruption-what-next\">What next?</a>\n    </div>\n\n  </div>\n</div>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

Comparisons may also be drawn from training civil servants in more established sectors, such as transparency and anti-corruption, to assess the overall effectiveness of training as an intervention for building sustainable capacity to execute open data policies and initiatives.</p>\n<p>Building off existing analysis by the ODI and others within the open data research community, the literature review will include a brief diagnosis of common approaches to training about open data, and common topics of training. It will also include an analysis of training needs, as expressed by civil servants from previous training need assessments and evaluations. Finally, the literature review will provide practical recommendations about how the ODI and others doing similar leadership support work, can improve the design of open data training programs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/9a/ad/559aadf31f986a1fdb000022/Screenshot_2015-07-06_14.32.42.png\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img text-center\" id=\"559aadf3f362be63d4000099\"> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hypTmeRmFz9UNlZWtESRtKKR2krmKTI1IVWY0IYXjWw/edit?usp=sharing\">A full brief can be found here</a></p>\n<p>Tender responses should be submitted to <a href=\"mailto:fiona.smith@theodi.org\">fiona.smith@theodi.org</a> by <strong>0900 BST on Monday 13 July 2015.</strong></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"Read the brief","url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hypTmeRmFz9UNlZWtESRtKKR2krmKTI1IVWY0IYXjWw/edit?usp=sharing"}],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

The exhibition is built around the practice of the 2016 ODI Sound Artist in Residence, Alex McLean, with a group of artists, designers, makers and musicians that he has collaborated with. Openness and processes of making – where any end results are left partly undone – are at the heart of many of the projects on display. The exhibition draws connections between the ways in which humans have captured, encoded and distributed data, and made it meaningful through pattern throughout history. From pre-Columbian Quipu and the ancient art of weaving to computer software environments, it introduces us to creative notions of code, and the ways in which it can carry both language and thought. </p>\n<p>The exhibition features artists and makers who are driven by radical intentions to expose the inner workings of the systemic structures we live with. We are encouraged to engage with these ourselves through art, software, folk songs, glitch aesthetics, chance encounters and knitted jumpers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bookavisit\">Book a visit</h3>\n<p>The artwork is displayed in the working offices of the Open Data Institute, so for a viewing please contact <a href=\"mailto:dac@theodi.org\">dac@theodi.org</a> to book a time slot to come and visit us. </p>\n<h3 id=\"artists\">Artists</h3>\n<p>Felicity Ford, David Griffiths and Julian Rohrhuber, Ellen Harlizius-Klück, Dan Hett, David Littler, Alex McLean, Antonio Roberts, Sam Meech, Amy Twigger Holroyd</p>\n<p>Curated by Alex McLean and Hannah Redler</p>\n<p><em>Alex McLean’s residency is made possible through a partnership with Sound and Music through their Embedded artist residency programme, supported by Arts Council England, the Esmee Fairbairn Foundation and PRSF Foundation.</em></p>","excerpt":"Thinking Out Loud is the fifth art exhibition at the Open Data Institute’s Shoreditch headquarters.\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"Thinking Out Loud art exhibition","end_date":"2017-03-31T16:00:00+00:00","location":"Open Data Institute, 65 Clifton Street, London EC2A 4JE","start_date":"2016-07-15T09:30:00+00:00","booking_url":"","hashtag":"ODOutLoud","event_type":"event:meetup","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Hannah Foulds","slug":"hannah-foulds","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/hannah-foulds","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme","odi-team"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/culture.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/culture","slug":"culture","title":"Data as Culture","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-08-19T11:02:10+00:00","created_at":"2012-11-25T22:02:06+00:00","tag_ids":["page","data-as-culture","culture","art","data-driven"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/alex-mclean-chosen-as-the-first-open-data-institute-sound-artist-in-residence.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/alex-mclean-chosen-as-the-first-open-data-institute-sound-artist-in-residence","slug":"alex-mclean-chosen-as-the-first-open-data-institute-sound-artist-in-residence","title":"Alex McLean chosen as the first Open Data Institute sound artist in residence","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-12-18T10:23:06+00:00","created_at":"2015-12-17T16:30:01+00:00","tag_ids":["news","data-as-culture","comission","alec-mclean","live-coding"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Hannah Foulds","slug":"hannah-foulds","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/hannah-foulds","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme","odi-team"]}}

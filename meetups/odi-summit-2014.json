Taking place over two days, we'll be hosting a training taster day, a conference full of world class speakers, and a gala dinner. We are delighted to be hosting the event at the <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk\">British Film Institute</a> for the day conference and the <a href=\"http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/london-wall/\">Museum of London</a> for the evening meal.<br>\n<br>\nThe ODI Summit is a celebration of the innovation and evolution of open data and its impact across cultural, economic, environmental, and social spheres.<br>\n<br>\nOur inaugural 2013 event celebrated the ODI's remarkable first year and drew comments such as “Best conference of the year” from attendees. We are building on that this November with the summit exploring the theme of “Open Innovation”. With 2014 marking the 25th anniversary of the Web, what better way to mark how far we’ve come than discussing the emergence of the next web: the web of data.<br>\n<br>\nJoin us for a day of gripping sessions that will explore the past, present and future of open data. <a href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/speakers-2014/\">Speakers</a> include our founders Sirs Tim Berners-Lee and Nigel Shadbolt amongst other open data luminaries and leading thinkers from business, government, technology and start-ups.</p>\n<p>Register now for the <a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/odi-summit-training-taster-day-tickets-12429499969?aff=eorg\">training taster day</a> (3 November) and <a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/odi-summit-2014-tickets-11838867371?aff=eorg\">conference and gala dinner</a> (4 November).</p>\n<h3 id=\"conferenceandgaladinner\">Conference and Gala Dinner</h3>\n<iframe src=\"//eventbrite.co.uk/tickets-external?eid=11838867371&ref=etckt\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"500\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<h3 id=\"trainingtasterday\">Training Taster Day</h3>\n<iframe src=\"//eventbrite.co.uk/tickets-external?eid=12429499969&ref=etckt\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>","excerpt":"<img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/f1/f9/53f1f9b3f362be08d7000018/logo.png\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img pull-right\" id=\"53f1f9b31f986a0851000013\">\r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"The ODI Summit returns in 2014 for two days of events","end_date":"2014-11-04T22:00:00+00:00","location":"London (Multiple Venues)","start_date":"2014-11-03T09:30:00+00:00","booking_url":"","hashtag":"ODISummit","event_type":"event:meetup","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

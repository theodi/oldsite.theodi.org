Would you like to see how it's used for yourself? Whether you have some knowledge of open data, work in a related field or are completely new to it, come along to the <strong>ODI's open house</strong> and see what the fuss is about.</p>\n<p>You'll have the chance to meet our team, have a snoop around our offices and see <strong>our latest Data as Culture art collection</strong>, all at the <strong>ODI HQ in Shoreditch</strong>. Oh, and we'll even ply you with drinks and snacks.</p>\n<p>ODI believes the cultural impact of open data is as essential to open data landscapes as environmental, economic and social benefits. Our ongoing art programme, Data as Culture (DAC) was established in 2012 with the companyâ€™s inception.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theodi.org/data-as-culture-2015-curators-statement\">Data as Culture 3: Data Anthropologies</a></strong> is the third season of the ODI's ongoing contemporary art programme, Data as Culture. The programme includes new commissions from Artists in Residence, co-commissions, partnerships, talks and lectures.</p>\n<p><strong>Artists in residence, Thomson & Craighead, will be on-hand to talk you through the works on display.</strong></p>\n<p>We hope to see you there!\nThe ODI team</p>\n<hr />\n<iframe  src=\"//eventbrite.co.uk/tickets-external?eid=16104965385&ref=etckt\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"214\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>","excerpt":"<img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/3f/6b/553f6b111f986a08fe000088/logo.png\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img pull-right\" id=\"553f6b11f362be74920000dc\"> \r","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"alternative_title":"ODI Event","end_date":"2015-05-20T17:00:00+00:00","location":"The Open Data Institute, 65 Clifton Street, London, EC2A 4JE","start_date":"2015-05-20T14:00:00+00:00","booking_url":"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/odi-open-house-data-as-culture-exhibition-tickets-16104965385","hashtag":"DataAsCulture","event_type":"event:meetup","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/culture.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/culture","slug":"culture","title":"Data as Culture","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-08-19T11:02:10+00:00","created_at":"2012-11-25T22:02:06+00:00","tag_ids":["page","data-as-culture","culture","art","data-driven"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/data-as-culture-2015-curators-statement.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/data-as-culture-2015-curators-statement","slug":"data-as-culture-2015-curators-statement","title":"Data as Culture 2015: Curator's statement","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:59:48+00:00","created_at":"2015-03-23T12:03:37+00:00","tag_ids":["page","data-as-culture","curator"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

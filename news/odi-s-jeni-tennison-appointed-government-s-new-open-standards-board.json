Open standards aren't just free to implement, they are created through an open process that ensures they take into account the requirements of multiple stakeholders. The problem with standards is that there are so many of them! Having different organisations adopting the same open standards ensures that data can flow easily between them, and that we can share common tools. The Open Standards Board will help government to pick the open standards that help it to meet its open data goals.\"</p>\n<p>\u0002\nThe Open Standards Board members appointed are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Liam Maxwell, Government Digital Service (Chair)</li>\n<li>John Atherton, Surevine</li>\n<li>Matthew Dovey, Jisc</li>\n<li>Adam Cooper, Bolton University</li>\n<li>Paul Downey, Government Digital Service</li>\n<li>Jeni Tennison, Open Data Institute</li>\n<li>Lee Edwards, London Borough of Redbridge</li>\n<li>Tim Kelsey, NHS Commissioning Board</li>\n<li>John Sheridan, The National Archives</li>\n<li>Chris Ulliott, CESG</li>\n</ul>","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Helen Desmond","slug":"helen-desmond","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/helen-desmond","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Helen Desmond","slug":"helen-desmond","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/helen-desmond","tag_ids":[]}}

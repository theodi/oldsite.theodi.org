The ODI provides grant funding, mentoring and promotional support to maximise these impacts. \nThe ODI received 83 applications in total for its <a href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-2016-spring-call-for-entries\">Spring call for entries</a> this year, a significant increase on the <a href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase\">2015 showcase</a>. Each application was reviewed and scored by the ODI team and five finalists were invited to interview. The ODI will now provide <strong>Out for the Count</strong> and <strong>PetaJakarta.org</strong> with up to £7,000 to support the delivery of their projects, and offer the teams with open data expertise, communications support and opportunities to connect to its global network, between April and July 2016.</p>\n<h3 id=\"outforthecountbuildingtheuksfirstlocalelectiontracker\">Out for the Count: building the UK’s first local election tracker</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-showcase-2016-out-for-the-count\">Out for the Count</a> will be creating the first easily accessible online platform with details of all local elections, their candidates and subsequent results, ahead of the elections on 5 May. Voting data will be collected by election observers – including both active citizens and council officers – which will feed into the online tracker, showing the number of votes for each local councillor. This data will then be republished as open data under a Creative Commons license. <a href=\"http://www.lgiu.org.uk/\">LGiU</a> and <a href=\"https://democracyclub.org.uk/\">Democracy Club</a> have teamed up on this project, and will work on it in partnership.</p>\n<h3 id=\"petajakartaorgusingdatatohelpbuildfloodresilienceinjakartaindonesia\">PetaJakarta.org: using data to help build flood resilience in Jakarta, Indonesia</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/news/odi-showcase-2016-peta-jakarta\">PetaJakarta.org</a> is a real-time map of flood conditions in Jakarta, Indonesia. Its aim is to help build resilience within government, communities and emergency services to extreme weather. The map combines citizen reporting, social media, government flood alerts and sensor data to provide critical information during flooding. PetaJakarta.org maps the location of flooding in real-time, with input from citizens using social media, helping the public and emergency services to target their response.</p>\n<p>PetaJakarta.org will be showcasing its success and the applicability of its approach anywhere in the world by using ODI Showcase funding to produce dynamic and accessible videos and infographics. The team hope that, by grasping the methodologies used by PetaJakarta.org, other cities can build their own software and data sharing processes for to improve resilience.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The ODI Showcase supports projects that demonstrate how open data can be used to bring longstanding benefits to individuals, organisations and society.

Exploring both ‘life data’ and the life of data, We Need Us uses metadata that is produced as Zooniverse’s millions of participants carried out projects and transforms it into responsive shapes and sounds. The work reminds visitors of the humanity in technology – data needs us, as much as we need it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/5f/77/565f77e2d0d4626a7a000001/ODI_WeNeedUs_redcomp_01_14-06-03.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"565f77e1f362be787800000a\"><br />\n<small>Julie selects initial shapes and forms that can be carried and altered by a constant flow of Zooniverse metadata that feeds the live work.</small></p>\n<p><strong>ODI team members power the show</strong></p>\n<p>Among the artworks, Data as Culture’s first Artists in Residence <a href=\"http://thomson-craighead.net/\">Thomson & Craighead</a> will be exhibiting <a href=\"http://thomson-craighead.net/londonwall.html\">‘London Wall (WC2)’</a> a specially commissioned wall of hand-printed posters that presents tweets and status updates collected within a one mile radius of Somerset House. </p>\n<p>‘London Wall’ was previously commissioned by the Museum of London and later recreated for the ODI Headquarters in Shoreditch as part of its <a href=\"http://theodi.org/news/data-anthropologies-the-open-data-institute-launches-third-season-of-data-as-culture-art-programme\">‘Data Anthropologies’</a> theme.  </p>\n<p>Video content shown throughout will also feature interviews with ODI co-founder, <a href=\"http://theodi.org/team/nigel-shadbolt\">Sir Nigel Shadbolt</a> and ODI CEO <a href=\"http://theodi.org/team/gavin-starks\">Gavin Starks</a> expressing the role data has to play in modern culture and society.</p>\n<p>ODI startup, <a href=\"https://opencorporates.com/\" title=\"OpenCorporates\">OpenCorporates</a>, joins the exhibition showcasing its over 85 million strong open database of companies worldwide, in over 100 jurisdictions.

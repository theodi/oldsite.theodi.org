We are working to adopt the standard in all our work, and look forward to being able to publish a set of UK contract data in the new year.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Chris Taggart, CEO of <a href=\"http://theodi.org/start-ups/opencorporates\">Open Corporates</a>, a UK company that provides open data about 84m companies worldwide, and a graduate of the ODI startup programme, said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The Open Contracting Standard may sound like an esoteric and irrelevant government project but by making procurement information as standardized open data it has the potential to help fight corruption, improve government services, fostering innovation, as well as making it much easier for citizens to see where their money goes.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As part of the announcement the Open Contracting Partnership are inviting governments <a href=\"http://standard.open-contracting.org/\">to access the Standard</a> and adopt the tools to ensure contracting is transparent and efficient, and citizens and NGOs are urged to monitor and analyse published data.</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}}

It is also blurring the traditional roles of business, government and NGOs by highlighting our collective responsibility to address acute global challenges. Above all, the data will be of value to farmers, enabling them to increase productivity sustainably and to enhance their livelihoods.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Jeni Tennison, Deputy CEO and CTO of the Open Data Institute, said:</em> </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Open data has the power to solve our most challenging sustainability problems. For example, how can we provide all the world’s people with adequate nutrition, whilst protecting our precious natural resources? Agri-tech businesses have a big role to play in finding novel solutions to these problems. It is encouraging that Syngenta is taking a step that puts them at the forefront of the open data movement in their sector. We look forward to working with them to unlock benefits for farmers and consumers worldwide.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Syngenta has standardized the published data and is working with the ODI to create a common language around the collection, measurement and sharing of crop-level information. This will improve understanding of how to best to deliver The Good Growth Plan commitments, which include helping to feed a growing global population by making crops more efficient while rescuing farmland and helping biodiversity flourish. </p>\n<p><em>Access the data from The Good Growth Plan <a href=\"http://www.syngenta.com/global/corporate/en/GoodGrowthPlanData/Pages/progress.aspx\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><small><i>Image is licensed under a (CC-BY-SA-2.0) license - <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mcdermottd/210837015/in/photolist-56Ptna-jCAuX-cUYyBm-dDFK4z-9VddDJ-fFKfDo-d159cu-9TAmXc-oSkHQy-a6ZGgf-a6WPUp-5BrTLT-8yG3jy-df4P8F-pu9HK-5uXP57-drYRMA-a6WQ4X-adEcJj-59UzC3-7K9N6F-64dNbX-9FawFo-8poKMD-sas694-8HZSis-8poKJX-8poKT6-nYWmHE-6jCoyt-cGVbAj-7K9N8c-o5U11U-6TS8NS-9Zrji9-dWPPP6-h8dJZ9-dgES5B-7KdGHQ-a6ZGbL-8poKPc-qrceYZ-o9gikL-f7dHs5-8poKW8-hP2w1y-rFpU-oLpqEr-otVKKT-ccY5TG\" title=\"Flickr: David McDermott\">Flickr: David McDermott</a></i></small></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"Access the data from The Good Growth Plan","url":"http://www.syngenta.com/global/corporate/en/GoodGrowthPlanData/Pages/progress.aspx"}],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

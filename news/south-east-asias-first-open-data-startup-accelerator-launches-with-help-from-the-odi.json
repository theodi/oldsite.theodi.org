Officials from the Malaysian government, who have an ambitious vision to improve the way the government supports its citizens to innovate, invited the ODI to help them achieve this goal. </p>\n<p>The ODI has worked closely with the MDeC (Multimedia Development Corporation) in order to support the Malaysian government. MDeC operates at arm’s length from government and has a role to promote technological innovation in the public and private sectors. </p>\n<p>Selected startups on the accelerator will be able to meet with startups from the ODI’s established <a href=\"http://theodi.org/start-ups\">startup programme</a> in the UK. This will begin immediately with two Malaysian startups attending the <a href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/\" title=\"ODI Summit\">ODI Summit</a> on 3 November. More startups will visit London in 2016 to learn about startup culture in the UK. </p>\n<p>Emma Truswell, Deputy Head of Services at the Open Data Institute said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We have seen UK startups thrive on the ODI Startup programme and we look forward to seeing East Asian businesses flourish with similar opportunities. Bringing together like-minded startups and supporting the creation of a stronger open data ecosystem will help data innovation across Malaysia and the region.    </p>\n</blockquote>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/start-ups.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/start-ups","slug":"start-ups","title":"Startups","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-07-12T15:36:35+00:00","created_at":"2013-11-19T17:08:42+00:00","tag_ids":["page","startup","mentoring"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}}

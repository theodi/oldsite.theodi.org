It's encouraging to see that most of those who answered the survey recognise the potential of data even if they don't yet understand how to realise that potential.</p>\n<p>There is clearly a challenge ahead in helping people to find and access the datasets they need, and giving them the right skills and knowledge to put them to good use. At the ODI, we are committed to working with organisations across the public and private sectors to help them share and use open data to develop and improve their businesses. This survey provides a useful benchmark against which to measure our progress in the months and years ahead\".</p>\n<p><em>Read a <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/blog/guest-blog-how-make-open-data-more-open-close-gaps\">guest blog on today's survey</a></em></p>\n<p>\u0002</p>","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}}

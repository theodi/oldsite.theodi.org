Not all data will be open data, but at the Open Data Institute we believe that we need an open debate about its management and use. The ODI is starting the debate by asking: <a href=\"http://theodi.org/who-owns-our-data-infrastructure\" title=\"“who should own data infrastructure, globally, nationally and locally?”\">“who should own data infrastructure, globally, nationally and locally?”</a></p>\n<p>Our co-founder, Sir Nigel Shadbolt will also kick off the discussion during his keynote speech today at the <a href=\"http://opendatacon.org/\" title=\"International Open Data Conference in Ottawa\">International Open Data Conference in Ottawa</a>. </p>\n<p><em>What do you think?

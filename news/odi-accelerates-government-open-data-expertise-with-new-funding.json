The grant is part of the bigger pot being released in the next two years by the government’s <a href=\"http://data.gov.uk/odug\">Open Data User Group (ODUG)</a>.</p>\n<p>The cash will fund two separate initiatives being run by the ODI. The first, worth £50k, will enable 74 key staff from government departments to attend ODI courses, including the one-day <a href=\"http://theodi.org/courses/open-data-day\">Open Data in a Day</a> and five-day, intensive <a href=\"http://theodi.org/courses/open-data-practice\">Open Data in Practice</a> programme.</p>\n<p>The ODI’s Head of Training, Kathryn Corrick said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We’re delighted to support more civil servants in getting up to speed with the latest developments in publishing and using open data. There’s no doubt that the UK is a world-leader in releasing public sector information as open data, and this training will ensure the quality and usability of that data for everyone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The second project announced today will focus specifically on embedding open data in public sector procurement practices. £100,000 will be spent in training 120 procurement officers and producing an online guide. </p>\n<p>Along with grants awarded to the ODI, other organisations will also receive project funding. Amongst them is the <a href=\"http://okfn.org/\">Open Knowledge Foundation (OKF)</a>, the organisers of Open Data Day.</p>","media_enquiries_name":"Emma Thwaites ","media_enquiries_email":"emma.thwaites@theodi.org","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

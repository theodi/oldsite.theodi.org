The work and its resultant exhibition or performance will join the programme’s arts projects that explore the intrinsic qualities of data, interpret how data may look, feel or sound, and apply novel uses of data beyond known applications.</p>\n<p>Founded by Sirs Tim Berners-Lee and Nigel Shadbolt in 2012, the ODI and its Data as Culture programme are committed to supporting artists to create new works that may improve conceptual understandings of data and where it can lead society. The composer will have the opportunity to immerse themselves in this culture, producing a unique sonic work to exhibit at the ODI HQ in Shoreditch and at the 2016 ODI Summit.</p>\n<p><strong>Hannah Redler, ODI Associate Curator in Residence said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The embedded composer will be Data as Culture’s first ODI Artist in Residence whose primary focus is sound. The partnership with Sound and Music allows us to raise questions about what the increasing volume of data tracking, informing, surrounding and defining us might begin to sound like. I can't wait to see what the selected composer comes up with. I'm very much looking forward to welcoming them to the ODI team.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can find out more about the application process [here](\nhttp://www.soundandmusic.org/projects/applications-open-embedded-open-data-institute).</p>\n<p><strong>Compose for dance with Sounding Motion!</strong></p>\n<p>Up to three composers will be selected as part of Sound and Music’s <a href=\"http://www.soundandmusic.org/projects/call-portfolio-sounding-motion\">Portfolio programme</a> to develop small-scale works for dance with Sounding Motion.  </p>\n<p>Sounding Motion is a collaborative company consisting of musicians (viola/ percussion) dancers, and a choreographer. The selected composers will have the opportunity to develop their collaborative skills and creative practice in workshops as they work in close partnership with instrumentalists, choreographer and dancers to develop a new short dance work for presentation by the company in late 2016. </p>\n<p>Sound and Music’s Portfolio scheme provides a key development opportunity for composers to create new work with and for some of the UK’s leading ensembles and presenters of new music. Portfolio enables them to develop their portfolio of compositions and gain vital artistic and practical insight and experience in working with professional ensembles and presenting organisations, and delivering new work to public audiences.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.soundandmusic.org/projects/call-portfolio-sounding-motion\">Find out more here.</a></p>","media_enquiries_name":"Patrice John-Baptiste","media_enquiries_email":"patrice.jb@theodi.org","media_enquiries_telephone":"+44 (0) 7931 387 769","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Patrice John-Baptiste","slug":"patrice-johnbaptiste","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/patrice-johnbaptiste","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme","team-member"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/culture.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/culture","slug":"culture","title":"Data as Culture","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-08-19T11:02:10+00:00","created_at":"2012-11-25T22:02:06+00:00","tag_ids":["page","data-as-culture","culture","art","data-driven"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Patrice John-Baptiste","slug":"patrice-johnbaptiste","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/patrice-johnbaptiste","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme","team-member"]}}

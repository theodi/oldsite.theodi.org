We welcome this report which gives a good summary of the current state of open data support within government.\"</p>\n<p>The publication of the PASC report comes as news emerged of the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26605375\">sale of public postcode data</a> as part of the Royal Mail privatisation, which it describes as a \"mistake\".</p>\n<p>Jeni Tennison said: </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The sale of postcode data as part of the privatisation of Royal Mail demonstrates short-sightedness and a real failure and lack of understanding of the wider benefits of public data. Royal Mail shows no signs of opening up that postcode data, only of tweaking their existing licence agreements. The Government needs to take steps to rectify their mistake, by building an open address database. It also needs to take steps to ensure that the transfer of public data to the private sector never happens again, particularly in the context of proposals to change Land Registry to become a government-owned company. We look forward to reading the Governmentâ€™s response to the PASC report.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Image Flickr:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mauricedb/2706292588/sizes/l/in/photolist-589sv3-5eKgMt-5ePFFU-5yPxrt-5yPGsk-5yPKmD-5yPUVc-5yPXi2-5yTNuQ-5yU7Qu-5yUaAo-kgvoqX-fvVK1t-iLJ6V6-7Zv9Md-7ZrYpv-7ZZD7e-7Zv9Gy-eYYgYm-e8rjkm-htNXJQ-c2JWAb-dAce6r-hEWK3q-dxDFxg-fFtqsL-f3jACC-9LA1nu-7Zv9yA-cNqHbN-eYLTQp-9LxFVB-ah78um-c3sAKw-hGpNeH-cYkW3o-fq953B-e1mEV1-cW3sDu-cAkDLU-bWefYE-gUp9yF-e2pY4h-eS9yTJ-dC4iPj-c58PdQ-dobG5f-hTG48T-bpMD9E-kJgMoB-kxW9nt/\">** Maurice **</a></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/publishers-guide-open-data-licensing.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/guides/publishers-guide-open-data-licensing","slug":"publishers-guide-open-data-licensing","title":"Publisher's Guide to Open Data Licensing","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:00:18+00:00","created_at":"2013-05-01T11:57:52+00:00","tag_ids":["guide","guide","guide","guide","guide","publishing"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

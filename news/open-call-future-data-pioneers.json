From <a href=\"https://citymapper.com/london\">Citymapper</a> to <a href=\"https://www.rentsquare.io/\">Rentsquare</a>, data has proved again and again to be the catalyst for innovation across sectors.</p>\n<p>This year at the annual <a href=\"http://theodi.org/summit/2016\">ODI Summit</a> on 1 November, we are centring our conversation around the future of data, particularly how datasets become much more useful when linked across the web – what we call the web of data. But data cannot innovate alone: it requires inspired, ambitious individuals to make connections between available datasets and unresolved problems. This is where you come in.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatareweasking\">What are we asking?</h3>\n<p>We are looking for people aged 16-30 to share with us how they think data can solve a local or global problem by submitting a two-minute video explaining an idea or project. You could be the CEO of a startup, undertaking a personal project, fiddling around on GitHub or have no background in data whatsoever – we're interested in hearing how you think data could improve the lives of yourself and others.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatsinitforme\">What's in it for me?</h3>\n<p>All submitted videos will be in consideration to feature in a compilation film airing at the ODI Summit to an audience of over 600 people.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, two winners will be invited on stage for our keynote session to discuss their idea as part of a panel with our founders Sir Tim Berners-Lee (inventor of the world wide web), Sir Nigel Shadbolt and board members Baroness Martha Lane Fox and Neelie Kroes. </p>\n<h3 id=\"whatquestionsshouldibeansweringduringthevideo\">What questions should I be answering during the video?</h3>\n<p>We are looking for answers to the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who are you and where are you based?</li>\n<li>How are you using data to solve a local or global problem?</li>\n<li>What other data would you like to have available to tackle this problem? How could this data be better linked?</li>\n<li>Finish this sentence: I want a future where <strong><em><em></em></strong></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Applications will be open from <strong>21 September</strong> until <strong>12 October</strong>, with successful applicants contacted in mid-October.

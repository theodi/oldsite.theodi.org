It sets out nine recommendations for the UK to continue to build on its open data successes.</p>\n<p>Some of the recommendations include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adopting an ‘all of government’ data strategy that brings together all aspects of data policy in one place in the Cabinet Office </li>\n<li>Creating a new Chief Data Officer to develop, advocate and progress all aspects of this strategy</li>\n<li>Building data publication into everything the Government Digital Service does, </li>\n<li>Empowering trading funds to release more open data, including Companies House, Ordnance survey, Met Office and the Land Registry </li>\n<li>Investing more in data training for government, business and citizens </li>\n<li>Mandating that public procurement contracts require the release of open data, in line with the UK’s commitment under the G8 Open Data Charter to ‘open by default’</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some recommendations come from discussions about building an open data roadmap in the past four months; others have been suggested by different stakeholders over the UK’s open data journey. Some echo recent proposals by the UK Government, which we support, like appointing a government Chief Data Officer. The roadmap sees the UK <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/382552/Efficiency_and_reform_in_the_next_Parliament.pdf\" title=\"Chief Data Officer\">Chief Data Officer</a> as having a crucial strategic leadership role overseeing the UK’s whole of data strategy. </p>\n<p>There is a lot more detail on how the UK Government could improve open data publication, what datasets need to be open, what data training might look like, that the ODI will expand on in the coming months. </p>\n<p>We welcome feedback from the open data community on the open data roadmap and how it can best be followed by government.

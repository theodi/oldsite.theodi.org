The ODI provides grant funding, mentoring and promotional support to maximise these impacts.</p>\n<p>The ODI received 52 applications in total for its summer call for entries this year. Each application was reviewed and scored by the ODI team and eight finalists were invited to interview. </p>\n<p>The ODI will now provide Open Inheritance Art, Great British Toilet App, Energy Sparks and VacSeen with up to £7,000 to support the delivery of their projects, and offer the teams with open data expertise, communications support and opportunities to connect to its global network, between September 2016 and March 2017.</p>\n<h3 id=\"openinheritanceartincreasingaccesstoartworks\">Open Inheritance Art: increasing access to artworks</h3>\n<p>Open Inheritance Art aims to provide dramatically increased access to a collection of over 36,000 works of art, which owners have granted access to in exchange for tax exemptions. However, despite being listed as \"tax exempt heritage assets”, these artworks aren't always readily accessible. Open Inheritance Art will encourage people to go out and see these items, photograph and upload them online, building on HMRC's public database. In other words, they want to recover them from being 'assets' and turn them back into art.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-showcase-winners-qa-open-inheritance-art\"><em>Find out more in the Q&A with the team</em></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"greatbritishtoiletmap\">Great British Toilet Map</h3>\n<p>The Great British Public Toilet Map project has been running for nearly two years. In that time the team has built up a database of over 10,000 toilets from open data and crowdsourcing to help people find toilets when away from home. Now they want to take it a step further, by analysing the map’s data to find out how public toilets are provided in the UK and who can access them. The team also plans to investigate how toilet provision compares across the country, factoring in differences in population, environment and age, which could affect local demand for facilities. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-showcase-winners-qa-great-british-toilet-map\"><em>Find out more in the Q&A with the team</em></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"energysparks\">Energy Sparks</h3>\n<p>Energy Sparks aims to help schools become more energy efficient by giving them better access to their energy usage data and presenting it on a platform so the whole school can access and use it. Visualisations will help show how schools' energy usage changes over time, and how it responds to interventions. The team also plans to run a local competition between schools to encourage them to use the platform.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-showcase-winners-qa-energy-sparks\"><em>Find out more in the Q&A with the team</em></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"vacseen\">Vacseen</h3>\n<p>The aim of Vacseen is to ensure that every child in the world has access to life-saving vaccines. Troves of proprietary and open data are available that can help governments, health authorities, non-profits, and manufacturers make informed decisions so that the right vaccine reaches the right child at the right time. Unfortunately, a lot of this data sits in isolated pockets and thus does not get utilised for decision-making. The team are linking these datasets to help the decision-makers in ensuring continued supply of vaccines to remote regions of the world.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-showcase-winners-vacseen-qa\"><em>Find out more in the Q&A with the team</em></a></p>\n<p><strong><em>The ODI Showcase supports projects that demonstrate how open data can be used to bring longstanding benefits to individuals, organisations and society.

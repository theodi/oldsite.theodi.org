Their work included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tracking road traffic accidents according to speed limits;</li>\n<li>Looking at the pattern of robberies for the time of year and assessing whether certain months were more likely to see higher crime rates;</li>\n<li>Analysing ASB (anti-social behaviour) hotspots and using them to advise on crime reduction measures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Winning Idea</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/legacy/sml%2Dall%2Dstudes%2D1.jpg\" alt=\"Lambeth students at the mash-up\" /></p>\n<p>Eight ideas were presented to the panel at the end of the event and all the experts agreed it was a very hard decision to choose one winner. A team from Dunraven school who looked at the correlation between population density and burglaries were named as the overall winners. Team members, Robin Watson and Alasdair Priestley will be invited to present their work to UK Government ministers at the opening of The ODI in December.</p>\n<p>The ODI 's CEO Gavin Starks said:</p>\n<p>\"We are at the start of an open data revolution, with the UK in a leading position. Challenging the status quo, and stimulating innovation to tackle some of the world's toughest issues is something we have to inspire and train our next generation of leaders to engage in.” \u0002\n<em>You can read more about the day in a <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/blog/dunraven-school-students-reflect-open-data-opportunities\">guest blog by Dunraven school</a></em><em>and hear some <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/blog/st-martins-students-their-data-mash\">personal experiences from St Martins students</a> about working with data</em></p>","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}}

While sharing experiences with other leaders in different contexts can help, even more useful is joining a network for long-term peer-learning and engagement.</p>\n<p>The ODI has today published a <a href=\"http://theodi.org/method-report-how-to-create-and-sustain-peer-networks-for-open-data-leaders\">method report</a> to help organisations, researchers and global development practitioners create successful peer networks that support leaders implementing open data initiatives, whether in the private or public sector. </p>\n<p>The report explores peer networks, their key features and what makes them most effective. It also raises ongoing challenges, such as how to sustain a network beyond the initial engagement stages. It forms one in a series produced by the ODI as part of the <a href=\"http://od4d.com/\">Open Data for Development Network</a>, supported by a grant from the <a href=\"http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Pages/default.aspx\">International Development Research Centre</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"peernetworksatoolforhighlevelreform\">Peer networks: a tool for high-level reform</h3>\n<p>The report finds that peer networks have great potential to support open data practice and facilitate high-level reform. People who participate in peer networks often feel more empowered, having boosted their social capital and learned new skills. Successful peer networks have a clear shared vision and formalised governance structure over time. </p>\n<h3 id=\"whatmakesasuccessfulpeernetwork\">What makes a successful peer network</h3>\n<p>Drawing lessons from a body of literature and peer network evaluations, the report offers recommendations for organisations or practitioners interested in convening peer networks to support open data leadership.</p>\n<p>Key recommendations include promoting <strong>‘network thinking’</strong> around participants, and helping them to build relationships through <strong>face-to-face and virtual engagement</strong>. Also important to network success is a focus on being flexible enough to <strong>meet external opportunities and adapt to the needs of network members</strong> – which may shift. </p>\n<p>The report finds that successful networks generally have a highly <strong>motivated convenor</strong> who attracts resources, mobilises members and engages new participants. They also use <strong>platforms that enable members to self-organise</strong>, engage and take ownership over actions. </p>\n<p>The report also recommends that network credibility and influence can be bolstered with <strong>high-quality research and outputs</strong>, produced by members, along with stories, tools, resources and guides. Finally, the report suggests that network success in the long-term depends on ongoing <strong>monitoring and evaluation</strong> of network outputs and outcomes, with input from members, so that approaches can be adapted where necessary.</p>\n<p><strong><em>If you have insights into open data and network building that you would like to share, we want to hear from you.

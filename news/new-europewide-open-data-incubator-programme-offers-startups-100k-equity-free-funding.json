ODInE is being delivered by the Open Data Institute (ODI), <a href=\"https://www.southampton.ac.uk/\">University of Southampton</a> and six other European partners, and has received €7.8m of EU funding from the EU’s <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/\">Horizon 2020</a> funding programme. New startups will be recruited every two months on a rolling basis. </p>\n<p>ODInE has been modelled on the ODI’s highly successful <a href=\"https://theodi.org/start-ups\">startup programme</a>, which has so far supported 18 companies, nine of which have now graduated from the scheme. Together these companies have secured over £4m in funding and investment since joining and they employ over 70 people.</p>\n<h3 id=\"applyingforodine\">Applying for ODINE</h3>\n<p>ODInE is aimed at small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) building a business around open data.

In the existing ODI programme we found that startups valued being immersed in an open data ecosystem with others going through the same experience. We are excited that this new programme will be Europe-wide, given Europe’s thriving startup ecosystem and its leadership in areas such as smart cities.”</p>\n<p>Eight partners, including the ODI, bid for the EU funding to develop ODInE: <a href=\"https://www.southampton.ac.uk/\">University of Southampton</a>, The Open Data Institute, <a href=\"http://www.telefonica.com/en/home/jsp/home.jsp\">Telefonica</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk\">The Guardian</a>, <a href=\"https://www.openfuture.org/en\">Open Future</a>, <a href=\"http://wayra.co/\">Wayra</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fraunhofer.de/en.html\">Fraunhofer</a>, <a href=\"http://okfn.de/\">Open Knowledge Foundation (Germany)</a>.</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/start-ups.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/start-ups","slug":"start-ups","title":"Startups","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-07-12T15:36:35+00:00","created_at":"2013-11-19T17:08:42+00:00","tag_ids":["page","startup","mentoring"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}}

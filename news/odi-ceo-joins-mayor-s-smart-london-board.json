We must harness the huge potential that new technology offers us and by drawing on the expertise of some of the brightest minds around we can make our great city an even smarter one too.  </p>\n<p>I’m delighted to welcome on board a fantastic line up of experts to help spur the kind of innovation and entrepreneurship that will secure London’s future as the best big city on earth.”  </p>\n<p>Joining Gavin Starks on the Board are experts including Joanna Shields, CEO, Tech City Investment Organisation and Mike Butcher, Editor of TechCrunch Europe, and co-founder of Tech-Hub London.</p>\n<p>Accepting his appointment, Gavin Starks said:</p>\n<p>“Open data is part of the fuel for smart cities. Whether energy or transport, health or education, financial or supply-chain data, everyone should be able to derive benefits from robust information. The Smart London Board is highly relevant to the ODI’s vision and mission, and will create and shape market opportunities for small businesses, and shorten the time it takes for innovative products and services to get to market. \u0002ODI is catalysing open data culture to create economic, social, and environmental value not just for Londoners but on a national and international scale.”  </p>\n<p>Related articles:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/media/press_releases_mayoral/mayor-announces-%E2%80%98smart-london%E2%80%99-board-realise-london%E2%80%99s-ambition-global-tech-leader\">http://www.london.gov.uk/media/press<em>releases</em>mayoral/mayor-announces....</a>  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c92146c4-842e-11e2-96f2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2MZpb1J2i\">http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c92146c4-842e-11e2-96f2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2MZpb1J2i</a>  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.londonlovesbusiness.com/business-news/tech/boris-johnson-launches-drive-for-smart-london/4901.article\">http://www.londonlovesbusiness.com/business-news/tech/boris-johnson-launches-drive-for-smart-london/4901.article</a></p>","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}}

Furthermore, openness is a core part of my practice of live coding, where all the code behind live music is on show. The ODI is a great environment to bring together my various activities around pattern in music, code and textiles, maybe opening up and transforming historical archives of pattern.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hannah Redler, Curator in Residence (ODI) said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Alex McLean has the gift of being able to produce work that is both genuinely avant-garde and highly accessible. His live coding performances and public workshops present the beauty of code and opens up its potential to broad audiences. We are terrifically excited to hear Alex’s sonic direction with open data, and delighted to welcome him as our first ever sound artist in residence in collaboration with Sound and Music.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Aimed at talented composers and creative artists, Embedded is Sound and Music’s bespoke professional development programme that gives composers the chance to work with a diverse range of innovative and established creative organisations, providing practical, hands-on experience as well as fostering long-term creative relationships. Partnering with the ODI for the first time, this residency will challenge the traditional ‘composer in residence’ model by creating a new context for sound artists in what is both a tech startup and a visually dominated space, reflecting the wealth of interdisciplinary collaboration in music today. </p>\n<p><strong>Kealy Cozens, Creative Project Leader (Sound and Music) said:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As a proudly open and data-driven organisation it’s really exciting for Sound and Music to work with the ODI to place their first ever sound artist in residence. Alex is an incredibly talented artist at the forefront of live coding and this opportunity to work with world-class pioneers such as the Open Data Institute signals brilliant and bold movements forward in both the art and data worlds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gavin Starks, CEO (ODI), added:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As data becomes pervasive in all our lives, we need new ways to engage and interact with it as a material. Alex’s specific style reveals the inner workings of the machine, helping to dissolve barriers around digital literacy and creating a causal performance experience for the data-driven age.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See <a href=\"http://theodi.org/culture\">theodi.org/culture</a> for more information</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"WATCH - ODI Summit 2015: Data as culture panel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApReWTqRwcU&list=PL6DDzoHu1cx1Lwng4iDBnjoCVEmkGapXr&index=26"}],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/culture.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/culture","slug":"culture","title":"Data as Culture","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-08-19T11:02:10+00:00","created_at":"2012-11-25T22:02:06+00:00","tag_ids":["page","data-as-culture","culture","art","data-driven"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-at-big-bang-data-exhibition.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-at-big-bang-data-exhibition","slug":"odi-at-big-bang-data-exhibition","title":"ODI features in full force at Big Bang Data art exhibition","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-12-04T12:24:44+00:00","created_at":"2015-12-02T15:36:20+00:00","tag_ids":["news","data-as-culture","art"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/what-is-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/what-is-open-data","slug":"what-is-open-data","title":"What is open data?","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-01-05T15:22:05+00:00","created_at":"2014-10-30T15:43:18+00:00","tag_ids":["page","open-data","explained","what-is","introduction","closed-data","shared-data"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/about-us.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/about-us","slug":"about-us","title":"About the ODI","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-12-13T14:10:00+00:00","created_at":"2013-10-22T22:44:14+00:00","tag_ids":["page","open-data-institute"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

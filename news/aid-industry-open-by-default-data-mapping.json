How are you?</strong></p>\n<p>Very well, thank you!</p>\n<p><strong>What do you, or your organisation, do in a nutshell?</strong></p>\n<p>We use OpenStreetMap and operate within the OpenStreetMap community to create free, open-licensed, up-to-date maps, used by relief organisations responding to disasters and humanitarian crises.</p>\n<p><strong>What first got you excited about open data?</strong></p>\n<p>Collaborating on Wikipedia and the travel guide <a href=\"https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Main_Page\">WikiVoyage</a>. I got excited by wiki-style collaboration, and found my way to OpenStreetMap when it was forming here in the UK. This style of collaboration is very much enabled by open licensing, as people share in a spirit of co-creation and co-ownership.</p>\n<p><strong>What are your biggest data challenges?</strong></p>\n<p>With a very large number of contributors it's easy to achieve areas of good detail and quality within map data, but achieving consistent levels of detail and quality is a big challenge. This requires coordination, which is an area the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team works on with tools like <a href=\"http://tasks.hotosm.org/\">Tasking Manager</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>What kind of open data would you like to see more of?</strong></p>\n<p>In the humanitarian realm, an \"open by default\" approach for data would unlock massive improvements in aid delivery. For mapping, we'd love to get hold of more data from teams on the ground, for example, teams using <a href=\"http://fieldpapers.org/\">fieldpapers.org</a> (paper), <a href=\"http://mapillary.com/\">mapillary.com</a> (smartphone), or <a href=\"http://openaerialmap.org/\">OpenAerialMap.org</a> (drone imagery). </p>\n<p>OpenStreetMap is a constantly updating editable map, which is a powerful thing, but the open data aspect is what makes it truly revolutionary. </p>\n<p><em><strong>If you have ideas or experience in open data that you'd like to share, <a href=\"mailto:production@theodi.org\" title=\"pitch us a blog\">pitch us a blog</a> or tweet us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/odihq\" title=\"@ODIHQ\">@ODIHQ</a>.</strong></em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"Open Data Awards","url":"http://awards.theodi.org/"}],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/announcing-the-2015-open-data-awards-finalists.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/announcing-the-2015-open-data-awards-finalists","slug":"announcing-the-2015-open-data-awards-finalists","title":"Announcing the 2015 Open Data Awards finalists","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:01:44+00:00","created_at":"2015-06-25T12:53:41+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","open-data-awards"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/typhoon-haiyan-and-the-humanitarian-openstreetmap-team.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/typhoon-haiyan-and-the-humanitarian-openstreetmap-team","slug":"typhoon-haiyan-and-the-humanitarian-openstreetmap-team","title":"Guest post: Typhoon Haiyan - Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team respond","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:53:06+00:00","created_at":"2013-11-25T14:23:03+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/budgit-open-data-nigeria-accountability.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/budgit-open-data-nigeria-accountability","slug":"budgit-open-data-nigeria-accountability","title":"BudgIT: ‘We give Nigerians accessible data, so they can hold leaders to account’","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:02:07+00:00","created_at":"2015-07-08T10:14:45+00:00","tag_ids":["news","open-data-awards","transparency","nigeria","africa","global-development"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/prioritise-open-data-to-drive-global-development.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/guides/prioritise-open-data-to-drive-global-development","slug":"prioritise-open-data-to-drive-global-development","title":"How to prioritise open data to drive global development","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:00:04+00:00","created_at":"2015-04-01T12:44:22+00:00","tag_ids":["guide","guide","guide","guide","open-data","partnership-for-open-data","government","how-to"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/mapping-lubumbashi-with-the-humanitarian-openstreetmap-team.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/mapping-lubumbashi-with-the-humanitarian-openstreetmap-team","slug":"mapping-lubumbashi-with-the-humanitarian-openstreetmap-team","title":"Guest post: Mapping Lubumbashi with the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:55:28+00:00","created_at":"2014-05-12T14:02:15+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/making-aid-data-more-useful-a-watchdogs-perspective.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/making-aid-data-more-useful-a-watchdogs-perspective","slug":"making-aid-data-more-useful-a-watchdogs-perspective","title":"Making aid data more useful: a watchdog’s perspective","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:00:20+00:00","created_at":"2015-04-21T11:53:47+00:00","tag_ids":["news","partnership-for-open-data","aidspan","global-development"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}}

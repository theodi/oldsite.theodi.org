A third of government expenditure is on public contracts. Contracting is plagued by opacity and inefficiency and is government’s number one corruption risk. Better, smarter and fairer government contracting will have a huge impact on people's lives. </p>\n<h3 id=\"howwouldyouusedatatostrengthentheintegrityandeffectivenessofpublicprocurement\">How would you use data to strengthen the integrity and effectiveness of public procurement?</h3>\n<p>Through the Open Contracting Innovation Challenge, we will award USD $60,000 in prize money. The six finalists announced will receive a cash prize of $5,000 and mentoring to develop their idea further. After three months, finalists will pitch for the grand prize of $30,000. The winner will be showcased at Open Contracting 2017 in November, with a special prize being awarded for the best government innovation. </p>\n<p>We are looking for entrepreneurs, government innovators, data journalists, civic technologists, hackers, open data enthusiasts and citizen activists who understand the transformational impact on people’s lives that better public contracting can have. We are particularly interested in ideas for projects that detect and prevent fraud &amp; corruption, deliver better value for money for governments, create fairer competition, and drive effective goods and service delivery for citizens.</p>\n<p><strong>To apply, go to:</strong> <a href=\"http://challenge.open-contracting.org\">http://challenge.open-contracting.org</a></p>\n<p><strong>Applications are open until 24 May.</strong></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/friday-lunchtime-lecture-can-open-data-improve-public-procurement.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures/friday-lunchtime-lecture-can-open-data-improve-public-procurement","slug":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-can-open-data-improve-public-procurement","title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: Can open data improve government procurement?","format":"event","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:54:26+00:00","created_at":"2014-01-03T12:01:56+00:00","tag_ids":["event:lunchtime-lecture"],"extras":{"start_date":"2014-01-24T13:00:00+00:00","end_date":"2014-01-24T13:50:00+00:00","location":"Open Data Institute, 65 Clifton Street, London, EC2A 4JE"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/standard-launched-to-ensure-transparency-and-efficiency-in-contracting.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/standard-launched-to-ensure-transparency-and-efficiency-in-contracting","slug":"standard-launched-to-ensure-transparency-and-efficiency-in-contracting","title":"Standard launched to ensure transparency and efficiency in contracting","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:55:13+00:00","created_at":"2014-11-17T16:59:03+00:00","tag_ids":["news","open-contracting","news"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-oil-we-look-forward-the-day-that-9tr-of-government-procurement-can-be-modelled-and-analysed.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/open-oil-we-look-forward-the-day-that-9tr-of-government-procurement-can-be-modelled-and-analysed","slug":"open-oil-we-look-forward-the-day-that-9tr-of-government-procurement-can-be-modelled-and-analysed","title":"Open Oil: 'We look forward the day that $9tr of government procurement can be modelled and analysed'","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-11-01T11:55:23+00:00","created_at":"2016-11-01T11:01:54+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","open-data-awards","transparency","procurement"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

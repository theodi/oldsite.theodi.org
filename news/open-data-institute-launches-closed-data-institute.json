We’ll be making sure we hold the door open, or close it, depending on who can benefit.” </p>\n<p>The ‘Closed Data Institute’ (CDI) will work along a business model similar to that of the ODI, offering training courses for public and private sector groups, developing a global network of closed, self-replicating data nodes, and an exclusive membership programme to world-leading groups, who cannot be named for legal reasons.</p>\n<p>Courses include ‘Closed Data in a Day’, ‘Identifying Colleagues in Closed Data’, ‘Keeping Institutional Knowledge on your Desktop’, and ‘Closed Data in Practice’ – a 3-day training course focusing on more technical Digital Restrictions Management applications. </p>\n<p>Further, ODI is pleased to announced its new EU Horizon 3030 research project 'AWMAN' (Avoiding aWkward situations where facts May get in the wAy of opinioNs)</p>\n<p>The location of the CDI has not yet been disclosed [due to a dispute with a geospatial data organisation].</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

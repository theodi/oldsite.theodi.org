The ODI plays a crucial role in building the case for open data in business. They have made great progress over the past two years and it is important that this momentum is maintained and built upon. In entering a further three-year agreement, Omidyar Network looks forward to supporting the ODI in its work to release the power of open data to address local and global issues.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>ODI CEO, Gavin Starks said: </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I would like to thank all of our supporters, member, partners and funders who have helped the ODI become a global agent for change so rapidly. With their help, we are demonstrating that open data is broad and deep in its influence. Businesses are seeing open data as a competitive advantage, governments are revealing insights and efficiencies, and startups are paving the way in the data-innovation landscape across all sectors. Open data will help inform policy, impact your daily decisions, shape design and affect our built environment. We must increase outreach in both data literacy and demonstrate the impact of open data and we must support organisations in their journeys from closed to shared, and from shared to open.”</p>\n</blockquote>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odis-second-year-annual-report.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odis-second-year-annual-report","slug":"odis-second-year-annual-report","title":"ODI's 2nd Year: Annual Report","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:59:16+00:00","created_at":"2015-02-18T11:07:28+00:00","tag_ids":["page","annual-report"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odis-first-year-annual-report.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odis-first-year-annual-report","slug":"odis-first-year-annual-report","title":"ODI's First Year: Annual Report","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:52:46+00:00","created_at":"2013-11-01T12:11:27+00:00","tag_ids":["page"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

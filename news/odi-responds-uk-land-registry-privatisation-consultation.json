privatisation consultation","url":"","content":"<p><em>In response to the UK Government consultation on privatising the Land Registry, the ODI is seeking input from data users and has released new economic research exposing the risks that come with restricting core public sector data assets</em></p>\n<p>The UK Government has issued a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/land-registry-moving-operations-to-the-private-sector\">consultation</a> on transferring the operations of the Land Registry to the private sector.\nThe ODI is preparing a response and wishes to learn more about the people and organisations that use Land Registry data or would like to use it in the future. </p>\n<p>We have <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ol8uw1u7EE9oGYjW0IR9OSXYmtw_Vk5jB_Likfp_rS0/edit\">published</a> the themes that we intend to use in our response openly and are <a href=\"http://goo.gl/forms/xgAQbRFxJ0\">gathering information</a> on how organisations use Land Registry data. <strong>Please comment before Friday 29 April.</strong></p>\n<p>We will then publish our draft response during May before it is submitted to government and, again, you will be able to comment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatwouldprivatisingthelandregistryandrestrictingitsdatameanfortheukeconomy\">What would privatising the Land Registry and restricting its data mean for the UK economy?</h3>\n<p>As part of its response to the consultation, the ODI has released <a href=\"http://theodi.org/research-economic-value-open-paid-data\">new research</a> by Lateral Economics on the economic value created by open data compared to the value created by paid data or data released under a restricted licence. </p>\n<p>The new report builds on <a href=\"http://theodi.org/the-value-of-open-data\">previous research</a> that demonstrates open data's value for the economy, and says that across all core public sector data assets open data will provide 0.5% of GDP more economic value every year than data that users have to pay for.</p>\n<p>We hope the research helps people make better decisions about the data that the Land Registry keeps and maintains both now and in the future, and about funding the publication and maintenance of <a href=\"http://theodi.org/what-is-open-data\">open data</a> as part of a <a href=\"http://theodi.org/data-infrastructure\">robust and open data infrastructure</a> more broadly.</p>\n<p>The consultation on the Land Registry closes on 26 May 2016.</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna

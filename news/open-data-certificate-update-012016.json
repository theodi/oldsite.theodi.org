In response to community feedback, we have simplified and renamed the certificate badges (previously Raw, Pilot, Standard and Expert) to a universal grading system of Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. This naming mechanism will help users to understand the measures taken to ensure a dataset’s quality, maintenance and support provided.</p>\n<p>For those already with certificates, any embedded badges will update automatically to the new badge icon and name.</p>\n<h3 id=\"anewautocertificationtoolmakesbulkcertificationeasier\">A new auto-certification tool makes bulk certification easier</h3>\n<p>To make the process of certifying existing open data faster and easier, we have created a <a href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/en/autocertification\">free auto-certification tool</a> that automatically drafts multiple Open Data Certificates in one go. </p>\n<p>Available for data publishers using CKAN or DCAT, the tool uses existing metadata stored in a data portal to fill in as many answers as possible. This makes it easier for publishers to kickstart the certification process and focus on adding extra information not already captured.</p>\n<h3 id=\"localisationin10countries\">Localisation in 10 countries</h3>\n<p>To apply Open Data Certificate to varying best practices and legal frameworks around the world, we have been working with local experts to translate them in other countries. Open Data Certificate is now part-localised in Greece, Canada, Czech Republic, Mexico, Italy, Taiwan, US, Romania and Germany. <a href=\"mailto:certificate@theodi.org\">Get it touch</a> if you would like to get involved in bringing Open Data Certificate to your country.</p>\n<p><strong>If you would like to know more about the changes to Open Data Certificate, please visit the new <a href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/\">website</a> for more details.</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>We’d love to know what you think of the changes, please get in touch at <a href=\"mailto:certificate@theodi.org\">certificate@theodi.org</a> or tweet us <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ODILabs\">@ODILabs</a>.</strong></em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Patrice John-Baptiste","slug":"patrice-johnbaptiste","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/patrice-johnbaptiste","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme","team-member"]}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"Open Data Certificate website","url":"https://certificates.theodi.org/"}],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-data-certificates-beta.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/open-data-certificates-beta","slug":"open-data-certificates-beta","title":"Open Data Certificates Beta","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:51:23+00:00","created_at":"2013-06-14T12:13:34+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/new-certificates-launched-help-everyone-discover-understand-and-use-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/new-certificates-launched-help-everyone-discover-understand-and-use-open-data","slug":"new-certificates-launched-help-everyone-discover-understand-and-use-open-data","title":"New certificates launched to help everyone discover, understand, and use open data","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:51:32+00:00","created_at":"2013-06-14T22:40:44+00:00","tag_ids":["news"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/5-star-open-data-certificates-tim-berners-lee.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/5-star-open-data-certificates-tim-berners-lee","slug":"5-star-open-data-certificates-tim-berners-lee","title":"Comparing the 5-star scheme with Open Data Certificates","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:59:40+00:00","created_at":"2015-02-20T17:03:04+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","open-data-certificates","open-data","linked-data","tim-berners-lee","5-star-scheme"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Patrice John-Baptiste","slug":"patrice-johnbaptiste","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/patrice-johnbaptiste","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme","team-member"]}}

They have been created by La Société Anonyme to help inform future generations about the diversity of European cultural life in years to come, when today’s computer systems are beyond recognition.</p>\n<p>Printed as raw data, the books contain greetings in four languages, binary encoded images, and sound files selected to portray the diversity of life and culture at the Foundation for Art and Public Domain (SKOR) in Holland. They also contain samples of artworks from different artists and eras. </p>\n<p>Printed as raw data, the files are protected from bitrot, software decay and hardware failure by being transformed from magnetic transitions on a disk to ink on paper; the data will be safe for centuries.

Can you still read the emails you were sent 20 years ago? How will you pass down digital photos and music to your grandchildren? In 1977 a snapshot of human culture was shot into space on the Voyager spacecraft: this book preserves a cultural record in a form that can be understood by our future terrestrial relatives, and embodies the principles of openness as the only mode of communication that persists.”</p>\n</blockquote>","media_enquiries_name":"Phil Lang","media_enquiries_email":"phil.lang@theodi.org","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Helen Desmond","slug":"helen-desmond","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/helen-desmond","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/culture.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/culture","slug":"culture","title":"Data as Culture","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-08-19T11:02:10+00:00","created_at":"2012-11-25T22:02:06+00:00","tag_ids":["page","data-as-culture","culture","art","data-driven"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/data-culture-recession-crisps-fuel-odi-staff.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/data-culture-recession-crisps-fuel-odi-staff","slug":"data-culture-recession-crisps-fuel-odi-staff","title":"Data as Culture: Recession Crisps Fuel ODI Staff","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:50:50+00:00","created_at":"2013-01-14T16:11:31+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Helen Desmond","slug":"helen-desmond","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/helen-desmond","tag_ids":[]}}

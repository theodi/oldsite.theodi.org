The report explores how open data could help customers to compare and analyse their banking data to ensure they are receiving the best deal for their money. Only 2-3% of bank consumers in the UK currently switch their accounts to an alternative banking institution. </p>\n<p>If UK banks were to adopt the open data recommendations set out in the report, more consumers would have access to information about banks before joining them, and would therefore not be burdened by the cost of switching providers.</p>\n<p>Jeni Tennison, Technical Director at the ODI believes the report will help to deliver a more transparent and accessible relationship between UK banks and their consumers.</p>\n<p>“We are excited by the prospect of the HM Treasury exploring the recommendations we delivered. Consumers can only benefit from being able to access their own banking information via APIs.”</p>\n<p>Early next year, HM Treasury will launch a call for evidence to explore how the recommendations can be adopted and delivered by UK banks to ensure openness in their transactions with their customers.  </p>\n<p><em>Download the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-sharing-and-open-data-for-banks\" title=\"full report\">full report</a> for more.</em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/guest-blog-data-catalyst-growth.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/guest-blog-data-catalyst-growth","slug":"guest-blog-data-catalyst-growth","title":"Guest Blog: Data as a Catalyst for Growth","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:50:43+00:00","created_at":"2012-12-02T21:15:02+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

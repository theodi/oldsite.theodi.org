The paper, drawing on the UK as an exemplar of best practice, uses popular open data definitions, business ecosystem theories, discourse analysis, and in-depth interviews with major UK stakeholders, to develop a full understanding of the UK open data environment and ecosystem. </p>\n<p>In addition, the ODI presented a further paper, <a href=\"http://project.opendatamonitor.eu/images/downloads/OpenDataMonitor_Publication_The-Tau-of-Data.pdf\">“The Tau of Data: A New Metric to Assess the Timeliness of Data in Catalogues”</a>, by <a href=\"http://theodi.org/team/ulrich-atz\">Ulrich Atz</a>, Head of Statistics at the ODI. Also supported by the ODM project, Ulrich’s paper reviews existing studies that assess the timeliness of data in catalogues (including the <a href=\"http://datacatalog.worldbank.org\">World Bank catalogue</a>, the <a href=\"http://data.gov.uk\">UK data catalogue</a> and the <a href=\"http://data.london.gov.uk_\">London Datastore</a>,) and proposes a new metric: tau, the percentage of datasets up-to-date in a data catalogue. Spotlighting timelines can foster efficiency and support the sustainability of the open data ecosystem, for example, by encouraging automated publication of data.</p>\n<p>The ODI’s <a href=\"http://theodi.org/research\">research programme</a>, currently includes 3 EU-funded projects; <a href=\"http://project.opendatamonitor.eu\">OpenDataMonitor (ODM)</a>, <a href=\"http://project.dapaas.eu\">Data-and-Platform-as-a-Sercvice (DaPaaS)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2013/share-psi/\">Share-Public Sector Information (PSI)</a>. The work presented in these two papers is indicative of how the ODM project is helping to create greater understanding of the open data landscape and ecosystem.</p>\n<p>When completed in November 2015, the ODM platform will deliver analysis and visualisation capabilities of local, regional and national open data hubs, giving insights into open data deployment across Europe. These analytics will help developers, entrepreneurs, policy makers and enthusiasts to understand how the open data ecosystem is evolving.</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Amanda Smith","slug":"amanda-smith","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/amanda-smith","tag_ids":["team","team","team","team","services-programme","person"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/research.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/research","slug":"research","title":"Research","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:57:46+00:00","created_at":"2013-10-17T10:39:51+00:00","tag_ids":["page","research","open-data"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-research-priorities-for-2014.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-research-priorities-for-2014","slug":"odi-research-priorities-for-2014","title":"ODI Research Priorities for 2014","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:55:26+00:00","created_at":"2014-02-24T17:28:20+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Amanda Smith","slug":"amanda-smith","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/amanda-smith","tag_ids":["team","team","team","team","services-programme","person"]}}

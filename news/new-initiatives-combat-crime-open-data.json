The\u0002 first challenge prize focused on crime and justice.

They will \u0002now be supported by the Open Data Institute and Nesta to develop \u0002their projects who will give them access to relevant expertise and\u0002 mentoring.

An overall winner will be chosen at the end of \u0002February and will receive a £40,000 prize.</p>\n<p>The ODI's Stuart Coleman said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It’s great to see such a range of \u0002people and ideas that use open data. The challenge approach means \u0002that we are seeing ideas that are unique, innovative and most\u0002 importantly, bringing positive\u0002 benefits to peoples’ daily lives.\u0002 These aren’t pie in the sky concepts but practical uses of open \u0002data which could deliver huge social and economic value.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Open Data Challenge Series is a two-year programme run by the \u0002ODI and Nesta and funded by BIS to solve social challenges using\u0002 open data resources. It encourages individuals and organisations to \u0002work with data providers, industry experts and business leaders to\u0002 develop ways of using open data sets to create new business\u0002 opportunities.</p>\n<p>The collaboration between the Open Data Institute and Nesta, will \u0002continue with six further series including Energy and the \u0002Environment, and Personal Data. The next Creation and Innovation\u0002 weekends will take place in January 2014.\u0002 For\u0002 more information the \u0002<a href=\"/challenge-series\">Open Data Challenge Series webpage</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Audio interviews with all seven teams can be found <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/sets/odcs_crime\">here:</a></strong></p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/12241173\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}}

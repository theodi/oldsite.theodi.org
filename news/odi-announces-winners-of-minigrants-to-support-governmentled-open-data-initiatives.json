The app hopes to improve data literacy in young people by introducing them to data-related concepts such as portals, analysis and visualisations. By using their own data, students will better understand the role of data in problem solving and will feel empowered to be more involved and informed in the decision making of their own school and local community.</p>\n<p>Get in touch with the team via Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gonzaloiglesias\">@gonzaloiglesias</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"edoagrihubedahbenincitynigeria\">Edo AgriHub (EDAH), Benin City, Nigeria</h3>\n<p>Edo AgriHub (EDAH) aims to map existing farms and produce in the state of Edo in Nigeria. Edo is one of the most agriculturally abundant states in the country, with favourable conditions for exportable goods. The state currently maintains a database of over 40,000 registered farmers, but without analysis this data has minimal impact. EDAH seeks to develop a platform that will be a repository of farmers' data which will be analysed and visualised regularly in order to aid decision making for government. By opening up the agriculture sector in the area, EDAH also hopes to eventually attract investors through their data visualisations and case studies. </p>\n<p>Get in touch with the team via Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@enkayfreda\">@enkayfreda</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"crowdsourcingzipcodepolygonsinmexico\">Crowdsourcing zip code polygons in Mexico</h3>\n<p>Continuing with its leadership in taking high-value open data to the Mexican population, the Coordination of National Digital Strategy of the Office of the President of Mexico, jointly with <a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/48.879/2.681\">OpenStreetMap</a> and the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, this project aims to fill these gaps to ensure that even the most remote areas of the country have a zip code.</p>\n<p>Following the experience of OpenStreetMap in other countries like Brazil, the Mexican Government will work collaboratively with several other public sector bodies to implement a pilot project to collect zip code information through digital technologies to eventually be published as open data in the government's <a href=\"http://datos.gob.mx/\">open data portal</a>. This pilot will not only be used to inform government on how to better crowdsource zip code data in the future, but will also help build Mexico's <a href=\"http://theodi.org/data-infrastructure\">data infrastructure</a>, helping the government to promote economic growth and more effectively react to natural disasters.</p>\n<p>Get in touch with the team via <a href=\"mailto:enrique.zapata@presidencia.gob.mx\">email</a></p>\n<p><em>Keep an eye out for more information on our other winners as well as updates on how these projects progress.</em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Alexander Leon","slug":"alexander-leon","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/alexander-leon","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-data-leaders-network-odi-grants-announced-to-support-governmentled-open-data-projects.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/open-data-leaders-network-odi-grants-announced-to-support-governmentled-open-data-projects","slug":"open-data-leaders-network-odi-grants-announced-to-support-governmentled-open-data-projects","title":"Open Data Leaders Network: ODI grants announced to support government-led open data projects","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-10-18T14:09:46+00:00","created_at":"2016-06-28T13:10:00+00:00","tag_ids":["news","open-data-leaders-network","odln","grants"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-data-leaders-network.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/open-data-leaders-network","slug":"open-data-leaders-network","title":"Open Data Leaders Network","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-04-20T15:43:41+00:00","created_at":"2015-06-19T16:28:38+00:00","tag_ids":["page","leaders-network","services","international"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/global-development-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/global-development-open-data","slug":"global-development-open-data","title":"Global development","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-10-31T15:13:28+00:00","created_at":"2015-09-25T15:41:46+00:00","tag_ids":["page","global-development"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Alexander Leon","slug":"alexander-leon","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/alexander-leon","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

This is mainly because air monitoring initiatives have been limited to certain areas around the airport, and the data they produce is not open for residents <b>to access, use or share</b>.</p>\n    <p>There are 14 automatic monitoring stations around Heathrow, which belong to Heathrow Airport Limited (HAL), local authorities and the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs (Defra). These cover areas in the immediate vicinity of the runways but do not provide real-time data feeds and can only be accessed via an email-requested data-dump, which is neither machine accessible nor readable for real-time applications such as Citymapper. </p>\n    <p>Responsibility for air monitoring across the UK is spread in somewhat of a patchwork. The majority falls under <a href=\"http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/networks/network-info?view=aurn\" title=\"Defra’s Automatic Urban and Rural Network\">Defra’s Automatic Urban and Rural Network</a> with approximately 140 sites operated by Bureau-Veritas; the data is managed and processed by Ricardo AEA. There are a number of other sites owned by Defra and managed by Ricardo but run day-to-day by local authorities, and there is yet a further tier of stations affiliated to Defra but run and operated by various companies for local authorities. </p>\n    <p>Aside from this, roughly a third of UK air monitoring is entirely independent and managed on an authority-by-authority basis.</p>\n    <blockquote>As I understand it, Ricardo AEA are – <a href=\"http://www.consultancy.uk/news/2409/ricardoaea-wins-uk-air-pollution-monitoring-contract\">due to their contract with Defra</a> – responsible for the distribution of air quality data... This means they currently handle the email request data-dumps and could be considered to be responsible for developing more modern and scalable methods of data distribution, such as <a href=\"https://api.opensensors.io/index.html\">APIs</a>.</blockquote>\n    <p><b> – James Moulding, Community Manager at OpenSensors and <i>Breathe Heathrow</i> team member</b></p>\n\n    <p>The Air Quality Expert Group, on which Ricardo sits, <a href=\"http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/assets/documents/reports/cat11/1509290925_DEF-PB14312_Evidential_value_of_Defra_air_quality_compliance_monitoring.pdf\" title=\"DEFRA report\">recently suggested</a> they are looking into providing more up-to-date and accessible means of procuring data. Until that time, there are few publicly operated real-time and accessible air quality monitoring networks in the UK. The largest is King’s College London’s <a href=\"http://www.londonair.org.uk/LondonAir/Default.aspx\" title=\"London Air Quality Network\">London Air Quality Network</a>, and its data is <a href=\"https://opensensors.io/orgs/London-Air-Quality-Network\" title=\"OpenSensors.io\">available at OpenSensors</a>.</p>\n    <p>There are number of independent, commercial and community-run air quality networks being established in the UK, such as the <a href=\"http://airqualityegg.com\" title=\"Air Quality Egg\">Air Quality Egg</a> community, which is now partnered with OpenSensors.</p>\n    <p>Change London’s <a href=\"http://www.airsensa.org\" title=\"AirSensa\">AirSensa</a> – a project aimed at monitoring air quality at schools in London – promises to become another air quality data provider, having received a £1m donation from Addison Lee founder John Griffin.

To bring its data to life, <i>Breathe Heathrow</i> also has a corresponding visualisation dashboard, showing how measurements vary over the cluster of devices, and over time for each device. The data is structured in a way that makes it easy to extract for visualisation. </p>\n    <p>The <i>Breathe Heathrow</i> tool allows users to drop into the dataset easily. By organising data by measurement type (CO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, temperature, humidity and noise levels) the team has been able to provide a structured open dataset. </p>\n    <img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/2f/af/562faf3a1f986a0851000007/breathe_heathrow_1.png\" title=\"Breathe Heathrow in action\">\n    <p></p>\n    <img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/2f/b0/562fb0b11f986a0851000009/breathe_heathrow_2.png\" title=\"Breathe Heathrow in action\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/CurlyN/HeathrowAnalysis\" title=\"Breathe Heathrow Dashboard\">dashboard</a> developed by <i>Breathe Heathrow</i> includes contour maps of data and time-series charts.

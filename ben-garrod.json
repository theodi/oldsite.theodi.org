Dick novels, several tumblr accounts, and an OHP. With these he has made perspectival trompe l'oeil wall paintings intended to collapse virtual and verifiable spaces through design-duration-documentation. Born in Bedford in 1981 he received a BA in Fine Art; painting, from Bath Spa University in 2005 or 2006, and is currently studying for an MFA in Fine Art Media at the Slade. He often works collaboratively with Lee Stone and Adam Burton. Recent work includes experiments with naive digital image/sound processing, and QR codes that address the viewer-phone as a posthuman consumer.</p>","organizations":[],"author":{},"image":{}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{}}

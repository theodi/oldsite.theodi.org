Dedicated to supporting better and more open information on elections and candidates, these volunteers are engaged and built upon each election by Democracy Club, a network of over 8,000 volunteers taking small actions to make democracy better.</p>\n  <p>Democracy Club’s director, Sym Roe, wrote the code for their website so it would allow anyone to enter results data, before a team of pre-approved admins ‘verified’ it.</p>\n  <p>In its capacity as a local government membership body and think tank, the LGiU helped to grow the number of Count Correspondents by engaging its existing networks of council officers and elected members.</p>\n\n<h3>Collecting election and results data</h3>\n\n<p>In the weeks before the election, the Count Correspondents gathered information from documents that listed candidates in their councils, as well as other resources such as social media pages and Wikipedia. This information was entered into the candidate database, created by Democracy Club, which fed the <a href=\"https://whocanivotefor.co.uk/\" title=\"WhoCanIVoteFor\">WhoCanIVoteFor</a> web application.</p>\n\n  <p>On the night of the election, from 11pm, LGiU rota-ed staff over the subsequent three days to process incoming data while results were announced.</p>\n  <p>“We focused initially on council control, as a change in council control makes the biggest difference to a council’s work,” Joe Mitchell, Coordinator of Democracy Club explains.</p>\n  <p>The team then continued to collect results data at an individual ward level: votes per candidate, winner, spoilt ballot and turnout recorded. They allowed anyone to add data, which was then verified by a team of trusted volunteers and staff at LGiU.</p>\n  <p>The results data so far has been made available in an online <a href=\"https://candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/uk_results/councils\" title=\"Out for the Count results\">results list</a> and <a href=\"https://candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/\" title=\"Out for the Count interactive map\">interactive map</a>. Full results data will be made available over the summer.</p>\n  <p></p>\n  <a href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about-collaboration\" title=\"Next page\"><img class=\"pull-right\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/16/43/56164300f362be08b400000f/summer_showcase_next_but.svg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n  <a href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about-the-data\" title=\"Previous page\"><img class=\"pull-left\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/29/f4/5629f4fe1f986a081e000033/previous.svg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n\n  </div>\n  <p></p>\n\n<div class=\"pull-left col-md-3\">\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about\">About</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-background\">Background</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about-the-data\">About the data</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box-opacity\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-methdology\">Methodology</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about-collaboration\">Collaboration</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about-what-next\">What next?</a>\n  </div>\n\n  </div>\n</div>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

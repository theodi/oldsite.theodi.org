It will be available via <a href=\"https://data.gov.uk/\" title=\"data.gov.uk\">data.gov.uk</a>, and is set to be certified with an <a href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/\" title=\"Open Data Certificates\">open data certificate</a> once live and available for use.</p>\n    <p><blockquote>Having worked so closely with Mind on developing their OpenHub platform as a tool for them to share data both internally and with their network of Local Minds, it made complete sense to us to start conversations around open data. We hope from these conversations to be able to show Mind the benefits that the use and release of open data can have to organisation like theirs.</blockquote></p>\n    <p><b>– Martin Vowles, Director of M/A</b></p>\n    <p>Having seen the power of the data within the OpenHub, M/A were inspired to consider how merging different organisations’ datasets could help create a fuller picture of mental health services and support across the UK.</p>\n    <p><blockquote>We felt that mental health technology was primarily focused around day-to-day emotion recording or support. A client told us about a report commissioned by the Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions: <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/departmentofhealth/pww-report?from_action=save\" title=\"Creating Digital Tools for Mental Wellbeing and Employment Support\">Creating Digital Tools for Mental Wellbeing and Employment Support</a>. After reading the findings it was clear to see that there was obviously a demand or need for this type of service, and we decided to develop this further.</blockquote></p>\n    <p><b>– Martin Vowles, Director of M/A</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <h3>Pulling different datasets into a useful mental health application</h3>\n    <p>M/A’s open web app <em><a href=\"https://www.plexus.support\" title=\"Plexus\">Plexus</a></em> was built using Django and Google’s Angluar.js, and its different data sources were housed by a Postgres database.</p>\n    <p>The data used within Plexus comes from multiple sources. The platform pulls data from <a href=\"https://openhub.io/\" title=\"OpenHub\">OpenHub</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/Performance/Search\" title=\"NHS Choices\">NHS Choices</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/employee-reservist/returning-to-work\" title=\"Gov.UK\">GOV.UK</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/employee-reservist/returning-to-work\" title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">Department for Work and Pensions</a>, <a href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/work/time-off-work/off-work-because-of-sickness\"> Citizens Advice</a>,\n    <a href=\"https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/construct/summary.asp?reset=yes&amp;mode=construct&amp;dataset=17&amp;version=0&amp;anal=1&amp;initsel=\">Nomis</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census-analysis/how-do-people-rate-their-health--an-analysis-of-general-health-by-long-term-limiting-illness-and-deprivation/index.html\" title=\"ONS\">Office for National Statistics</a>, <a href=\"https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/getajob/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"National Careers Service\">National Careers Service</a>, <a href=\"http://employeevolunteering.co.uk/\" title=\"Employee volunteering\">Employee volunteering</a>, <a href=\"http://www.time-to-change.org.uk/get-involved\" title=\"Time to Change\">Time to Change</a> and <a href=\"http://timebank.org.uk\">Timebank UK</a>. For more on the types of data, see ‘How does data fit in?’</p>\n    <p>Where these sources have application programming interfaces (APIs), Plexus pulls its data from those – in this case, Mind’s OpenHub dataset, NHS choices and the DWP employment statistics all have APIs. Where they do not, the data is collected by .csv and .xls or scraped using import.io.</p>\n    <p>Plexus now also includes a user account login for the app. The user has three choices: create a new profile, use an existing Facebook or Google account or use the app without having logged in. This stops users from being discouraged against exploring Plexus because they have to log in.</p>\n    <p><blockquote>We expect repeat users to eventually create accounts because of the additional functionality this will give them access to in future iterations of Plexus.</blockquote></p>\n    <p><b>– Martin Vowles, Director of M/A</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n\n    </ul>\n    <div>\n      <a href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-plexus-collaboration\" title=\"Next page\"><img class=\"pull-right\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/16/43/56164300f362be08b400000f/summer_showcase_next_but.svg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n      <a href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-plexus-about-the-data\" title=\"Previous page\"><img class=\"pull-left\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/29/f4/5629f4fe1f986a081e000033/previous.svg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n    </div>\n\n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"pull-left col-md-3\">\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-plexus\">About</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-plexus-background\">Background</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-plexus-about-the-data\">About the data</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box-opacity\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-plexus-methodology\">Methodology</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-plexus-collaboration\">Collaboration</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-plexus-what-next\">What next?</a>\n    </div>\n\n  </div>\n</div>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

For data to be considered ‘open’, it must be published in an accessible format, with a licence that permits anyone to access, use and share it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-an-open-data-company\">What is an open data company?</h3>\n<p>We define an open data company as one that uses, produces, or otherwise invests in open data as a key aspect of its work. It could be a data publisher, making data open for others to use. It could be a user, creating services with open data made available by other platforms. Or it could be an enabler, training or advising others in how to work with open data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"open-data-companies-are-distributed-across-the-uk\">Open data companies are distributed across the UK</h3>\n<p>UK companies do not need to be small, agile startups located in the tech communities of East London to engage with open data. Our research revealed that open data companies are located across Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and all regions of England.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/4b/70/554b70f81f986a08f100000d/UKMap-all-post.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img pull-left\" id=\"554b70f8d0d46207ba00003f\"></p>\n<p><em>Figure 1.1: Map showing the location of 270 UK open data companies determined by main trading address, where available (223 companies), otherwise by registered company address (47 companies).</em> (<a href=\"/open-data-means-business-appendices#licensing-attributions\" title=\"Credits\">credits</a>)</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/4b/6d/554b6de7f362be095800000d/2015-05-07_14-53-36.png\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"554b6de71f986a0869000034\"></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R00TmmjTmXSVY0-elg0nj8cn1koz736huWfpkcgs9pY/pubhtml?gid=318227754\" title=\"Table 1.1 data\">Table 1.1</a>: Location of 270 open data companies by country and region (based on ONS regions as defined in the National Statistics Postcode Lookup).

(<a href=\"/open-data-means-business-appendices#licensing-attributions\" title=\"Credits\">credits</a>)</p>\n<p>While open data companies are located across all parts of the UK, the distribution between regions is uneven. Some of this skew can be attributed to the distribution of companies more generally, but not all. For example, around half (51%) of the open data companies identified are located in London (compared to 17% of all businesses based on ONS figures). We can look more closely at these companies by mapping their distribution across the capital.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/4b/76/554b768dd0d4620885000012/LonMap-all-post.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"554b768df362be08d1000048\"></p>\n<p><em>Figure 1.2: Map showing the location of 139 London-based open data companies determined by main trading address, where available, otherwise by registered company address.</em> (<a href=\"/open-data-means-business-appendices#licensing-attributions\" title=\"Credits\">credits</a>)</p>\n<p>Open data companies are spread across London, covering 19 boroughs. For a full breakdown of companies by borough, please see <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R00TmmjTmXSVY0-elg0nj8cn1koz736huWfpkcgs9pY/pubhtml?gid=0\">Appendix Table A1.1</a>. The highest concentrations of these companies in individual boroughs can be found in Camden and Westminster (both 17%). More than one quarter (26%) are based in the boroughs of Hackney and Islington combined. This can likely be attributed to the East London technology cluster around Old Street roundabout, which is located on the border of the two boroughs. This cluster represents 13% of all open data companies in the UK. So while open data companies are evidently not exclusively a ‘Silicon Roundabout’ phenomenon, they have a disproportionately high presence in this area.</p>\n<h3 id=\"uk-companies-old-and-new-are-investing-in-open-data\">UK companies old and new are investing in open data</h3>\n<p>Open data companies in the UK vary in age, as revealed through analysis of their incorporation dates.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/4b/79/554b7910d0d4620885000014/age-histogram-simple.png\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"554b7910f362be08d100004b\"></p>\n<p><em>Figure 1.3: distribution age of 270 UK open data companies by age since incorporation date</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/4b/7a/554b7a03d0d4620885000016/2015-05-07_15-43-47.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"554b7a03f362be08d100004c\"></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R00TmmjTmXSVY0-elg0nj8cn1koz736huWfpkcgs9pY/pubhtml?gid=1558162434\" title=\"Table 1.2 data\">Table 1.2</a>: Age of UK open data companies by incorporation date.

The median age for a UK open data company is eight years, with just over a third of companies (34%) between four and nine years old. When this is considered alongside the 39% of companies that are more than 10 years old, it becomes clear that open data can be leveraged by well-established companies as well as recent startups. In fact, the oldest identified open data company is over a century old.</p>\n<h3 id=\"uk-companies-across-a-range-of-industries-are-using-open-data\">UK companies across a range of industries are using open data</h3>\n<p>Open data companies in the UK are operating in a wide variety of 13 industries.

(<a href=\"/open-data-means-business-appendices#licensing-attributions\" title=\"Credits\">credits</a>)</p>\n<p>Companies we identified operate in 13 out of the 17 broad industry groups recognised by the ONS. Over half (54%) of the open data companies operate in the <strong>information and communication</strong> industry. This is notably larger than the 8% of all UK companies in this industry, which was to be expected given the focus of this research.</p>\n<p><strong>Professional, scientific and technical activities</strong> made up over a fifth (21%) of all open data companies. A further 11% of open data companies are in the category of <strong>business administration and support services</strong>. The remaining ten industries each have a relatively small amount of representation. According to the SIC industry classifications of broad industry groups, open data companies were not represented in agriculture, forestry &amp; fishing, accommodation &amp; food services, property or motor trades.</p>\n<p>While the SIC industry classifications are able to provide a picture of the industries in which open data companies operate, they do have some limitations. Given the system was first designed in the 1940s and the codes were last updated in 2007, it may fail to effectively capture emerging industries and technologies.</p>\n<p>A second issue to be considered is that SIC codes may not accurately denote the industry which open data companies work in. For example, companies that provide open data products and services may be classified under information and communication, even though they provide the majority of their products and services to specific industries, such as ‘Agriculture, forestry &amp; fishing’, ‘Accommodation and food services’ or ‘Property’. This explains the zero frequencies shown in the table for these broad industry groups, despite the presence of companies such as Syngenta, FoodTrade and Illustreets in this study.</p>\n<h3 id=\"uk-companies-large-and-small-are-using-open-data\">UK companies large and small are using open data</h3>\n<p>Micro, small, medium and large enterprises are working with open data.

Europe, and how we feel about it, is certainly a hot topic at the moment and I’m excited about the opportunity to create innovations responding to the needs that are arising. AppChallenge are a crowdsourcing company, based in London, who have been helping the UK Data Service to build their first open data API working with data provider Eurofound in Dublin, Ireland. They are running an AppChallenge using this open data with £15,000 in prizes on offer.</p>\n<p>So what's in the data? #EULife provides the Eurofound European Quality of Life Survey from 2007 and 2011. This includes questions about family life and marriage, education, employment, income and health. Eurofound have even developed a loneliness index based on the underlying data. </p>\n<p>AppChallenge have worked closely with the UK Data Service to prepare the data which has received an ODI certificate. As well as making the data available for download they have built the first UK Data Service Open Data API together and provided comprehensive freely available video tutorials available to help novices access the challenge. The #EULife AppChallenge is the final stage in their work together and is designed to get developers across the world involved in using the data.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>EULife is open now and closes on September 30th 2015. There are nine AppChallenge prizes totalling £15,000 and you can win more than one and your entry! You can enter at their website by making an app, uploading a video of it working and submitting it along with your details at: <a href=\"http://eulife.appchallenge.net\">http://eulife.appchallenge.net</a></strong></p>\n<p><em>Prizes include a special young person's prize for 16-24 year old coders.</em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/opendatachallengeseries.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/opendatachallengeseries","slug":"opendatachallengeseries","title":"Open Data Challenge Series","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-11-09T12:15:14+00:00","created_at":"2012-12-13T09:45:46+00:00","tag_ids":["page","event:open-data-challenge-series","challenge-series","open-data"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{}}

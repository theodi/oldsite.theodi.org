She also spent a while trying to work out what's next after the publication of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shakespeare-review-of-public-sector-information\">Shakespeare review</a> the previous week.\u0002\n<a href=\"http://theodi.org/people/sam-pikesley\">Sam</a> spent the week getting more of our applications into continuous deployment.

This meant lots of talking to the rest of the ODI, to find out what they really needed; good news is, we all seem to want the same things, and even better, we might be able to reuse a lot of things that <a href=\"http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/category/gds/\">GDS</a> have written for gov.uk.

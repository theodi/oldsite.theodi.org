That’s one in every nine people, with the majority being women and children. </p>\n<p>Last week, I attended the <a href=\"http://summit.godan.info\">Global Open Data in Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN) Summit</a> in New York. The summit asked a big question: <strong>how can open data help to end global hunger</strong>? The summit involved world leaders, researchers, farmers, students and others – public, private and non-profit, united around a collaboration on agriculture and nutrition data openness. </p>\n<p>While the summit explored how open data can be published and used to help create a sustainable food supply, I was struck once again by the importance of openness more broadly. At the ODI we often talk about open innovation - ways of working to re-use data, skills, systems and resources with partners and collaborators – and embrace open solutions that arise from anywhere. </p>\n<p>What are the benefits of this open approach? Pace, agility and cost savings. </p>\n<p>Talking about ‘ending global hunger’ can easily sound over-ambitious. Certainly, organisations and individuals working in isolation can’t solve it; nor can we wait for grand top-down designs. The challenges posed by a growing population – including the supply of nutritious food – can only be solved by pulling down organisational and cultural barriers, and taking an open and iterative approach to innovation as well as data. That work needs to start now.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Jeni Tennison is <a href=\"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison\">CEO</a> at the ODI.

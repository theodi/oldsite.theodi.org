While the world leaders have largely held their positions, they are being <a href=\"http://theodi.org/news/open-data-barometer-the-odi-publishes-key-research-as-challenger-initiatives-gather-speed\">challenged by a new generation of open data adopters</a>.  </p>\n<p>Open data commitments and initiatives are spreading fast, and the majority of countries now have an open data initiative. Burkina Faso is one country that is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/dec/04/why-data-was-crucial-to-burkina-fasos-first-election-since-uprising\">gaining global recognition</a> for its open data initiative. <a href=\"https://theodi.org/news/burkina-faso-launches-open-data-initiative-with-mentoring-from-the-odi-and-funding-from-the-world-bank\">Launched</a> in June 2014, the <a href=\"http://data.gov.bf/\">Burkina Faso Open Data Initiative</a> (BODI) aimed to drive economic growth, boost innovation and demonstrate transparency, with support from the ODI and the Partnership for Open Data. </p>\n<p>Open data has been integral to transparency in Burkina Faso. In this interview, Malick talks about the challenges that came with promoting an ‘e-cabinet’ in Burkina Faso – from reassuring colleagues weary of ministers 'wasting time on the internet', to overcoming technical obstacles. </p>\n<p>Malick also reflects on positive uses and impacts of open data in his country, and how he helped persuade the Electoral Commission and the President to embrace open data in <a href=\"https://theodi.org/blog/a-year-in-open-data-how-the-odi-helped-to-deliver-a-successful-democratic-transition-in-burkina-faso\">enabling Burkina’s freest and fairest elections</a> in almost 30 years. </p>\n<p>The European Commission called the transition in Burkina Faso <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-283_en.htm\">\"remarkable\"</a> and the peaceful elections \"a victory for Burkina Faso, but also good news for the region and the continent\".</p>\n<p>This podcast was recorded while Malick was at ODI HQ in London to attend the <a href=\"https://theodi.org/open-data-leaders-network\">Open Data Leaders Network</a>, a programme for open data leaders from around the world to get together to share knowledge and ideas, discuss common challenges and, ultimately, learn from one another.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/260194420&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><br>\n<em><strong>This podcast was presented by <a href=\"https://theodi.org/team/anna-scott\">Anna Scott</a> and produced by Freya Hellier and <a href=\"https://theodi.org/team/phil-lang\">Phil Lang</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>If you have ideas or experience in open data that you'd like to share, <a href=\"mailto:production@theodi.org\" title=\"pitch us a blog\">pitch us a blog</a> or tweet us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/odihq\" title=\"@ODIHQ\">@ODIHQ</a>.</strong></em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-data-leaders-in-government-finally-have-a-support-network-each-other.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/open-data-leaders-in-government-finally-have-a-support-network-each-other","slug":"open-data-leaders-in-government-finally-have-a-support-network-each-other","title":"Open data leaders in government finally have a support network – each other","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:02:56+00:00","created_at":"2015-08-11T10:45:34+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","open-data-leaders-network","open-government"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/a-year-in-open-data-how-the-odi-helped-to-deliver-a-successful-democratic-transition-in-burkina-faso.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/a-year-in-open-data-how-the-odi-helped-to-deliver-a-successful-democratic-transition-in-burkina-faso","slug":"a-year-in-open-data-how-the-odi-helped-to-deliver-a-successful-democratic-transition-in-burkina-faso","title":"A year in open data: How the ODI helped to deliver a successful democratic transition in Burkina Faso","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-12-23T13:19:25+00:00","created_at":"2015-12-23T07:35:43+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","burkina-faso","elections"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-data-leaders-network.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/open-data-leaders-network","slug":"open-data-leaders-network","title":"Open Data Leaders Network","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-04-20T15:43:41+00:00","created_at":"2015-06-19T16:28:38+00:00","tag_ids":["page","leaders-network","services","international"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}}

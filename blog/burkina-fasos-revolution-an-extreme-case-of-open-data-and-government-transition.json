You can find the minutes of their last cabinet meeting online <a href=\"http://www.gouvernement.gov.bf/spip.php?article1449\">here</a>. </p>\n<p>The summer before the revolution a small team in a government agency had built an alpha <a href=\"http://data.gov.bf\">open data portal</a> and <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/97404977\">pilot app</a> together with volunteers from <a href=\"http://ouaga.jokkolabs.net/\">civil society</a> and some <a href=\"http://theodi.org/news/burkina-faso-launches-open-data-initiative-with-mentoring-from-the-odi-and-funding-from-the-world-bank\">support from the ODI</a> and World Bank. It was <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/110899480\">presented at the 2014 ODI Summit</a> by the Director General Alfred Sawadogo. </p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/110899480\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/110899480\">Alfred N. Sawadogo - Burkina Faso: setting the bar high for e-government</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/theodiuk\">Open Data Institute</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p>ANPTIC, the agency in charge of promoting of ICT, is located across the street from the old parliament building. It has grown in head count by 60 since last October, funded through the core government budget. This has enabled the open data team to expand to 6, with support from a wider team that now includes, for example, a director with responsibilities for applications. New apps for <a href=\"http://vimap.data.gov.bf/vimap/faces/apropos.xhtml\">searching government contracts</a> and <a href=\"http://cirdo.data.gov.bf/index.html#\">suggesting open data </a> projects have been developed. </p>\n<p>The team last week brought together directors with responsibility for statistics from each of the 27 ministries for two days of training on open data. The World Bank had just signed off on a $300,000 grant to expand the project to include a focus on drought risk in this largely agrarian country prone to extremes of weather. The team are also exploring an open elections project – examining how their skills can contribute to a successful transition. One idea is to build an open API and platform so election results can be known more speedily – watch this space!</p>\n<p>Huge challenges remain of course, not least the maintenance of the stability which has characterised the four months since the revolution. Recent history is full of warnings of revolutions ended in turmoil. </p>\n<p>And yet Burkina Faso can be seen as, perhaps, an extreme example of an open data initiative dealing with a transition of government, but this is a challenge that many governments face. And there are potential lessons we might take from their experience to date.  </p>\n<p>We often think that it is the economic arguments that will make open data sustainable and give programmes longevity. However, it might just be that transparency at a time of transition brings buy-in in two ways. The first is that transparency is usually a good strategy for signifying a change to business as usual, especially in contexts where trust is low. </p>\n<p>The second is that a transition is a good time to push for transparency, as at least in the immediate term, the actions and decisions being exposed are those of someone else. </p>\n<p>But then again, a lesson might be that tapping into the current political trend or catching the zeitgeist is a good way to stay relevant, and for open data initiatives to thrive in the context of political transition. </p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Liz Carolan","slug":"liz-carolan","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/liz-carolan","tag_ids":["team","services-programme","person","global-development"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/burkina-faso-launches-open-data-initiative-with-mentoring-from-the-odi-and-funding-from-the-world-bank.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/burkina-faso-launches-open-data-initiative-with-mentoring-from-the-odi-and-funding-from-the-world-bank","slug":"burkina-faso-launches-open-data-initiative-with-mentoring-from-the-odi-and-funding-from-the-world-bank","title":"Burkina Faso launches open data initiative with mentoring from the ODI and funding from the World Bank","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:55:49+00:00","created_at":"2014-06-05T08:56:42+00:00","tag_ids":["news"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/steps-towards-positive-government-civil-society-engagement-an-okfest-update.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/steps-towards-positive-government-civil-society-engagement-an-okfest-update","slug":"steps-towards-positive-government-civil-society-engagement-an-okfest-update","title":"How to build relationships between government and civil society - #OKFest ","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:56:14+00:00","created_at":"2014-07-15T15:59:19+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Liz Carolan","slug":"liz-carolan","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/liz-carolan","tag_ids":["team","services-programme","person","global-development"]}}

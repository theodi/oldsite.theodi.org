However, times are changing, and obstacles are being removed so now <em>anyone</em> can publish small- to medium-sized datasets without trouble.</p>\n<p>One tool that has made data publishing easier is <a href=\"http://octopub.io\">Octopub</a> created by the ODI tech team before the end of 2014. It’s designed to help non-technical people release small amounts of data with a licence, and is an easy to navigate ‘front end’ of GitHub, a tech platform used for coding.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve created a login to Github (if you do not have one), you can take the following steps to publishing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Complete a simple form with basic information about the dataset name, source, and how often you expect to update the data</p></li>\n<li><p>Choose an option for licence attribution</p></li>\n<li><p>Upload dataset(s) of choice</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the click of a button, the dataset is then available for anyone to access, use or share, along with metadata about the frequency of publishing and licensing information. To celebrate, you can then add an <a href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/\">Open Data Certificate</a> (another user friendly tool) verifying the data as open.</p>\n<p>I used Octopub to release <a href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/datasets/24216/certificate\">my first dataset</a>; feedback from our week-long session which launched the first cohort of our <a href=\"https://theodi.org/news/national-leaders-create-global-network-open-data-impact\">Open Data Leaders Network</a> in London, supported by the<a href=\"http://od4d.net/\"> OD4D Network</a>.</p>\n<p>The project helps individuals in governments leading the implementation of open data initiatives by providing an opportunity for them to share knowledge, experiences and challenges with peers from around the world. Our second cohort of the Open Data Leaders Network launched this month, with participants from around the world including Argentina, Nigeria and Romania.</p>\n<p>A running theme throughout the Open Data Leaders Network is the importance of training for individuals inside and outside government to understand what open data actually is, and the benefits of being ‘open by default’.</p>\n<p>Octopub is a small tool in a list of easy-to-use applications, such as <a href=\"http://openrefine.org/\">Open Refine</a> and Open Data Certificates, designed to bring people who are not necessarily from a technical background closer to the data. These tools make it easier to publish, sort and improve the quality of the data.</p>\n<p>In order to increase understanding and fully reap the social, environmental and economic potential of open data, we need to encourage more individuals to physically engage with data that is being released.</p>\n<p>So, non-techies, there’s no reason not to explore at least one dataset: whether you release it, sort it or refine it. Like me, you’ll discover just how easy it is to ‘get your hands dirty’ with open data.</p>\n<p>**_Dawn Duhaney is <a href=\"https://theodi.org/team/dawn-duhaney-2\">Junior Analyst</a> at the ODI.

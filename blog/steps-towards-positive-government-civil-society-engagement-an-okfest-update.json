Her work has found that progress in open data initiatives is not determined by GDP but rather that rates of civil society and government engagement are much more important. </p>\n<p>The speakers gave some of their advice for fostering positive civil society and government collaboration, which can be summarised as follows: </p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Invest heavily in fostering relationships:</strong> Government open data initiatives rely on civil society and developers reusing data and acting as intermediaries for citizens. Our panelists said that this requires a substantial and sustained investment. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Focus on specific projects:</strong> Burkina Fasoâ€™s small developer community mobilised around building <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/97404977\">an app</a> focused on education outcomes within a tight timeframe. Defined objectives that people can get passionate about and quick wins can help mobilize the energies of different communities.  </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Build a team of allies across sectors invested in making your project a success:</strong> For Bantay.ph, it was critical to have support from the Philippines Civil Service Commission within the government as well as other private and non-government sectors, such as the Makati Business Club which incubated the organisation.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course, constructive relationships alone will not lead to successful open data initiatives. The four speakers, and many in the audience, also highlighted the importance of political will, leadership, and well-timed support. </p>\n<p>However open data ecosystems cannot thrive without both effective government and civil society institutions - and effective collaboration between the two. The Partnership for Open Data is uniquely placed to bring together in one partnership the support governments need and the support civil society needs to make open data work for everyone. </p>\n<p><em>Each of the speakers received support from the Partnership for Open Data. The ODI provided remote mentoring to the teams in the governments of Mexico and Burkina Faso to, while Happy and Joachim will have six months intensive support via the <a href=\"http://schoolofdata.org\">School of Data</a> Fellowship.</em></p>\n<p><em>The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/p4opendata\">Partnership for Open Data</a> started less than a year ago and brings together the Open Data Institute, the Open Knowledge Foundation and the World Bank to help policy makers and citizens in developing countries understand and exploit the benefits of open data.

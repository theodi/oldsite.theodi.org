Yesterday we caught up with data and information architect <a href=\"http://devinit.org/old_site/author/bill/\" title=\"Bill Anderson\">Bill Anderson</a>, one of the people tasked with drafting the final ADC based on the groups' discussions. We asked what we could to do help. \"Be pithy!\" he said. And with that in mind:</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatisthedatarevolution\">What is the ‘data revolution’?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.uneca.org/datarevolution\" title=\"Data is the lifeblood of decision-making and the raw material for accountability\">Data is the lifeblood of decision-making and the raw material for accountability</a>. Without high-quality data providing the right information on the right things at the right time to the right people, designing, monitoring and evaluating effective policies becomes almost impossible. In 2014, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon tasked an <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/Press%20Release_Announcement_Secretary%20General%27s%20Independent%20Expert%20Advisory%20Group%20on%20Data%20Revolution.pdf\" title=\"Independent Expert Advisory Group\">Independent Expert Advisory Group</a> with making recommendations on bringing about a ‘data revolution’ to help drive sustainable development. The group’s report combined perspectives from different data communities and called on the world to embrace different data sources, tools and technologies to provide data for decision-making, service delivery and citizen engagement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rightsowhatisopendataandhowdoesitfitin\">Right. So what is ‘open data’ and how does it fit in?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/what-is-open-data\" title=\"Open data is data that anyone can access, use and share\">Open data is data that anyone can access, use and share</a>. By publishing and using open data, public sector groups can make better decisions, citizens can hold leaders to account, and the private sector can create jobs and boost economic growth. Essentially, open data should underpin all aspects of sustainable development. </p>\n<p><strong>Without open data, the data revolution for sustainable development will fail.</strong> </p>\n<p>Why?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open data is the foundation that <strong>supports collaboration between governments, the private sector, academia and civil society to solve long-term, complex development challenges</strong> </li>\n<li>Open data helps different actors working together to <strong>improve services and programmes for development</strong></li>\n<li>Ultimately, open data is key to <strong>ensuring that the Sustainable Development Goals can be monitored</strong> in a transparent and accountable way</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We’re here in Addis, supported by the <a href=\"http://www.idrc.ca/\" title=\"International Development Research Centre\">International Development Research Centre</a>, to share the many social, environmental and economic benefits that it can bring to developing and developed countries alike. Over the next few days, we’ll draw on our <a href=\"http://theodi.org/odp4d\" title=\"recent experience\">recent experience</a> in the continent – namely in Morocco and Burkina Faso – where we helped introduce open data in their public sector. </p>\n<p>In the months ahead, we’ll continue to work with African partners to promote open data across the continent, with support and funding from the IDRC and the <a href=\"http://od4d.net/\" title=\"OD4D Network\">OD4D Network</a>. </p>\n<p>We’re looking forward to some great discussions over the next few days, and we’ll be sure to blog updates. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Follow our tweets <a href=\"http://www.example.com\" title=\"@ODIHQ\">@ODIHQ</a>\nand join the discussion with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CoMAfrica15\" title=\"#CoMAfrica15\">#CoMAfrica15</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ODAfrica2015\" title=\"#ODAfrica2015\">#ODAfrica2015</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DataRevAfrica\" title=\"#DataRevAfrica\">#DataRevAfrica</a>.</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>To find out more about our work on open data and global development, see our <a href=\"http://theodi.org/odp4d\" title=\"Partnership for Open Data\">Partnership for Open Data</a>\n page.</em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odp4d.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odp4d","slug":"odp4d","title":"Partnership for Open Data","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:00:06+00:00","created_at":"2013-10-28T16:55:50+00:00","tag_ids":["page","international","development","global-development","pod"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}}

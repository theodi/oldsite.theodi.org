In these meme-fuelled, data-overloaded, statistically skewed times, we are asking how, when and where can data be funny. </p>\n<p>Data infrastructures are revealing themselves to direct, redirect or misdirect our news, our governments and ultimately our cultures. How can we find the comedy â€“ dark or light â€“ in the flow of data surrounding us?</p>\n<p>For the next Data as Culture art exhibition we are looking for artworks that interrogate data in ways that raise a wry smile, a full blown LOL, or a Black Mirror-style swipe at the future of open data. </p>\n<p>Data as Culture is the art programme for the Open Data Institute. Exhibitions take place in the working environment, alongside ODI staff and visitors.</p>\n<p><strong>Selection criteria</strong></p>\n<p>We are looking for framed or unframed, wall or screen-based works in any media which:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>present data as a humorous material for â€˜funny ha-haâ€™ or â€˜funny peculiarâ€™ art propositions</li>\n<li>consider the funny or absurd uses and misuses of data in emerging data and open data landscapes</li>\n<li>play with the growing number of visual gags in online environments, eg <a href=\"http://twistedsifter.com/2016/03/puppy-or-bagel-meme-gallery/\">chihuahua or muffin</a></li>\n<li>raise critical questions or extend common experience of data in relation to the stated theme</li>\n<li>creatively engage with the innovative, material and experiential qualities of data and its broader impacts on culture and society</li>\n<li>inspire ODI staff and visitors to think differently about data and its ability to tell stories or frame questions</li>\n<li>contribute to a richer visual environment in the ODI space</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Small objects may be accommodated. \nWe are particularly keen to receive proposals that incorporate <a href=\"https://theodi.org/what-is-open-data\">open data</a>.</p>\n<p>We are not looking for: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>direct data visualisation</li>\n<li>fragile, interactive works </li>\n<li>works that need assistance or complex instructions</li>\n<li>long narrative pieces</li>\n<li>continual externalised sound, although headphones are possible</li>\n<li>toxic or hazardous substances</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The works will be seen within a working environment with a â€˜captiveâ€™ audience, of staff so material that may be deemed obscene or offensive will not be considered.</p>\n<p><strong>The site</strong></p>\n<p>The exhibition programme will take place across a series of screens, walls, shelves and cabinets in the ODI headquarters in Shoreditch, London. Please see images of previous exhibitions below.</p>\n<p><strong>Audience</strong></p>\n<p>The audience are professional adults, who are often tech-savvy and time-poor. They will respond most strongly to an experience that is immediately impactful, striking or engaging. They are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>people who work at the ODI</li>\n<li>people who work with the ODI, including SMEs, startups, university departments, government ministers and departments, officials, delegations and major multinational corporations</li>\n<li>members of the public (who will visit the exhibition by prior arrangement)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ODI will also promote the project via its website and other social and traditional media channels.</p>\n<p><strong>Application process</strong></p>\n<p>Only applications submitted in the correct format via this <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/9dTd7WDUyGZNrt523\">online form</a> will be accepted.</p>\n<p>The form requests the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name</li>\n<li>Email</li>\n<li>Telephone number</li>\n<li>Biography: your practice, approach and experience (250 words maximum)</li>\n<li>A link to your website</li>\n<li>Description of the proposed work to include an outline of concept, description of visitor encounter, * materials and approx. dimensions (300â€“500 words)</li>\n<li>Link to image(s) of the proposed work â€“ 6 maximum</li>\n<li>Link to video of the proposed work â€“ 2 minutes maximum (optional)</li>\n<li>Link to press coverage and/or relevant articles (optional)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Eligibility</strong></p>\n<p>The call is open to all artists working with data, and we actively encourage applications from the groups below who are currently under-represented within our sector.

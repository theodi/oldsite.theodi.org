Using Paul Fitzpatrick's brilliant <a href=\"https://github.com/paulfitz/daff\">daff</a> library, I put CSV diffs into GitLab (an open source GitHub clone), but then again most people aren't using that.</p>\n<p>Shortly after this, GitHub added CSV viewing support in their web interface, which is fantastic, but still doesn't handle changes well.</p>\n<p>Well, this week was innovation week again, and my colleague Stuart came up with the suggestion of putting the CSV diff capability we did for GitLab into a browser plugin that would work on the main GitHub site. This seemed like an excellent idea.</p>\n<p>In the end, it was pretty easy, and version 1.0.0 is now released! If you're running Chrome, you can install it from the Chrome Web Store by clicking below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/csvhub/dbemglgpbebafkibfncdpdmdikacingf\">Install CSVHub now!</a></p>\n<p>It will let you see additions, deletions and modifications per-cell, in both commit views and pull requests.</p>\n<p>Want some examples? Install the extension and take a look at these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/test-data/commit/9f391e6e35963b96aa0eed56c20ccd70f326e1f7\">theodi/test-data</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/datasets/s-and-p-500-companies/commit/e64871e745a0d34ec3a0ae1b702886a1925d4cdf#diff-fc13dde00d8f846b940d1524b58652f9R269\">datasets/s-and-p-500-companies</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/datasets/gold-prices/commit/92d91c206a3b5ab2b4bb74575409eff1221d31cb\">datasets/gold-prices</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's open source, of course, so if you want to contribute improvements, or find any errors in it, you can visit the <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/csvhub\">GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n<p>And, if you're from GitHub, I would dearly love to have this built in to the main site. I've even written you a <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/coopy-ruby\">Ruby port of the daff code</a> so you can do it all server side. Go on, you know you want to!</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"James Smith","slug":"james-smith","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/james-smith","tag_ids":["team","rnd-programme","research-and-development","odi-labs"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/git-data-publishing.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/git-data-publishing","slug":"git-data-publishing","title":"Git for Data Publishing","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:51:24+00:00","created_at":"2013-05-20T09:35:06+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/adapting-git-simple-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/adapting-git-simple-data","slug":"adapting-git-simple-data","title":"Adapting Git for simple data","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:52:41+00:00","created_at":"2013-08-19T14:10:22+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"James Smith","slug":"james-smith","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/james-smith","tag_ids":["team","rnd-programme","research-and-development","odi-labs"]}}

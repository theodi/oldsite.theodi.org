It powers our digital lives and helps turn the cogs of the apps and digital services we use every day. </p>\n<p>But data is often shy, invisible and undetected, lurking beneath the surface of our smartphone screens as we navigate around our cities or search our new favourite dance jams.</p>\n<p>At the ODI, we like to think of <a href=\"http://theodi.org/data-infrastructure\">data as infrastructure</a>. You know, like water pipes or telephone lines. We know these things exist, but we don’t really need to think about them, as long as they keep working and providing us with what we need to keep functioning. </p>\n<p>But we do need to think about our data infrastructure, because it isn’t as strong or open as it needs to be – yet. If we work on making as much important data open – <a href=\"http://theodi.org/what-is-open-data\">for anyone to access, use and share</a> – then more people will be able to build services on top of it. Services we need to get from A to B. Services we need to help us find somewhere to live. And, well, services we need to help find our next favourite dance jams. </p>\n<h3 id=\"1citymapperhttpscitymappercom\">1. <a href=\"https://citymapper.com/\">Citymapper</a></h3>\n<p>This award-winning navigation service, now serving 20 major cities (and counting), allows users to seamlessly navigate their urban jungles and make best use of their public transport options, from buses to cycle hire.

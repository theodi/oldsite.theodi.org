These guidelines should include using a standard format for publication, such as the <a href=\"http://standard.open-contracting.org/\" title=\"data standard link\">Open Contracting Data Standard (beta version)</a>. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>The submission builds on work the ODI's already done in the area of open data and public procurement, including a <a href=\"http://training.theodi.org/Procurement/Guide/\">Guide to Procurement and Open Data</a> and a <a href=\"http://theodi.org/news/odi-hails-mps-demand-for-greater-transparency-in-public-sector-outsourcing\">training program for public procurement officers</a>. </p>\n<p>Have a look at <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/theodi.org/document/d/1N758j2erzt8pmn-O7JW9SwVzvbKvTkzfBdJPrYGtBrQ/edit#heading=h.ceesugyrhp6a\">the draft document</a> and let us know your feedback either as in-line comments or by emailing <a href=\"policy@theodi.org\">policy@theodi.org</a>. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately the timeline for comments is limited: final submissions are due on <strong>Thursday 13 November</strong>, which means there's only two days to add your input.

That's a bit of a mouthful, and also meant that it was our first week of reckoning; could we deliver what we'd committed to for this sprint? The focus of this sprint was enabling: 1) the growing range of ODI courses to be showcased on <a href=\"http://theodi.org/courses\">theodi.org/courses</a> (currently being populated), and 2) potential attendees to actually register for them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/people/james-smith\">James</a> spent lots of time with <a href=\"http://theodi.org/people/louise-burke\">Louise</a>, where he got a crash course in accounting, before automating the raising of invoice in our accounting software, <a href=\"http://www.xero.com/\">Xero</a>, via their API and the indispensible <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/xeroizer\">Xeroizer</a>. He also created more <a href=\"https://github.com/defunkt/resque\">Resque</a> jobs, this time to cache data retrieved from the <a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/\">Eventbrite</a> API for embedding courses pages on <a href=\"http://theodi.org/\">theodi.org</a>. <a href=\"http://theodi.org/people/sam-pikesley\">Sam</a>, meanwhile, provisioned some new infrastructure for running our production queues.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/tom-heath\">I</a> continued my Drupal-wrestling saga from the week before, modelling course data as new content types which we could export using the <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/features\">Features</a> module and manage in <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/www/tree/master/drupal-features\">GitHub</a>. <a href=\"http://theodi.org/people/stuart-harrison\">Stuart Number 2</a> finally joined us full-time and was a very welcome buddy; together we tamed Drupal.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/people/jeni\">Jeni</a> broke out her JavaScript skills and integrated the course pricing and availability data client side into the course pages. Without any major headaches or lost weekends we closed off all open issues by the end of the week, ready for our Monday morning demo.

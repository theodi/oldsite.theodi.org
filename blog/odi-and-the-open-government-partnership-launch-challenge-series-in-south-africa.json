They're deceptively simple, and as <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/sites/default/files/challenge-prizes-design-practice-guide.pdf\">recent research from Nesta shows</a>, they are also making a comeback.</p>\n<p>The ODI and the <a href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/country/south-africa\">Open Government Partnership</a> are at the forefront of this resurgence. The <a href=\"http://challenge.responsivecities.org.za/\">Responsive Cities Challenge</a>, launched earlier this month in South Africa, invites innovators and problem solvers from across the country to solve social challenges using open data.</p>\n<p>Each participating city has identified a problem that could be tackled using open data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In Tshwane, we ask <a href=\"http://challenge.responsivecities.org.za/static/files/RCC2016-ChallengeBrief-Tshwane-v8.pdf\">how open data can be used to reduce cable theft</a></li>\n<li>In Ekurhuleni, we ask <a href=\"http://challenge.responsivecities.org.za/static/files/RCC2016-ChallengeBrief-Ekurhuleni-v4.pdf\">how open data can assist residents that are at risk of natural disaster, crime, or disease</a></li>\n<li>In eThikwini, we ask <a href=\"http://challenge.responsivecities.org.za/static/files/RCC2016-ChallengeBrief-eThekwini-v4.pdf\">how open data can better connect governments to citizens</a>   </li>\n<li>And in Northern Cape, we ask <a href=\"http://challenge.responsivecities.org.za/static/files/RCC2016-ChallengeBrief-NC-v7.pdf\">how open data can improve water management in cities and towns</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The challenges are open to anyone within the country who feels they have a solution to these issues, from startups, to NGOs, to individuals.</p>\n<p>In mid-November, participants will have a chance to work with city representatives, ODI mentors and other key stakeholders to build out their value proposition and workable prototypes. Winners will receive cash awards, incubation and/or seed funding up to R300,000 (GBP ~17,000) to develop their solutions further.</p>\n<p>After the resounding success of the <a href=\"https://theodi.org/opendatachallengeseries\">Open Data Challenge Series</a>, run in collaboration with Nesta in 2014, this new Responsive Cities Challenge demonstrates again how a challenge series format provides an innovative framework through which to create social value.

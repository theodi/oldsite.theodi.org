This was the first of such sprints, and we were quite busy bees:</p>\n<p>Tom hosted the first <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/storm-london/events/115541332/\">Storm London Meetup</a> on Monday night and reacquainted himself\u0002with <a href=\"http://www.mongodb.org/\">MongoDB</a>\u0002and got to know the Ruby driver, he finally made sense of <a href=\"https://github.com/resque/resque\">Resque</a> and built a small app to harvest our pinboard bookmarks. He also hacked <a href=\"http://www.raspberrypi.org/\">Raspberry Pi</a>s with Andrea, our Training and Events Coordinator,\u0002and tested to see if they had enough grunt to drive the screens (they don't, unless we can offload more of the work to the GPU), helped Ulrich get setup on Rackspace collecting data about Boris Bikes, and enabled one of our pods for videoconferencing using the Samsung SmartTV.</p>\n<p>James went to UCL to <a href=\"http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/research-software-development/seminar-smith-odi/\">deliver a presenation on our open development practices</a>, (<a href=\"http://theodi.github.io/open-development/talk/#/titlepage\">you can see the slides here</a>), and worked on a <a href=\"http://git-viewer.labs.theodi.org/\">Rails app that displays open data stored in Git repositories</a>\u0002in\u0002a nice way for non-developers.</p>\n<p>I worked on <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/odibot\">various different scripts</a> for our IRC bot, <a href=\"http://hubot.github.com/\">Hubot</a> to do various life-embettering things like add bookmarks to Pinboard, alert us to when the 10am standup is happening (and give a link to the Google Hangout - handy for\u0002remote workers!), link automatically to issues in Github\u0002and also silly things like\u0002generate random words on the fly (this has already saved us several man hours in naming new projects - because naming things is hard).</p>\n<p>Sam worked on (in his words) <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/vagrant-provide-o-matic\">a horrorshow of a Vagrantfile</a> which will allow us to spin up nodes on the fly for either VirtualBox (when we're developing on our local machines) or Rackspace (when we want to put stuff into production). Once the rough edges are smoothed out, this will prove to be really useful.</p>\n<p>Ulrich worked on collecting data about Boris Bike cycle hire data using R, with a view to collecting a decent amount of statistical data so we can find out interesting patterns of usage. He also worked on a benefit case for opening up the DVLA's bulk data set as open data, and organised a meeting with various privacy experts\u0002to discuss the privacy section of the Open Data Certificate.</p>\n<p>Overall, it was a great week, and I think all of us packed a lot into five days. While we may not have got many demonstratable projects out of the sprint (it was only a week after all), it's helped lay some groundwork for some useful future projects, and we've all leant at least one useful thing that we can carry forward into future work.</p>","organizations":[],"author":{}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{}}

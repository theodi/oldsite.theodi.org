The ability to automate data conversion and cleaning helps make a process repeatable, which is essential if you're doing more than just a one-off task.</p>\n<p>My current favourite tool for working with CSV files is <a href=\"https://csvkit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\">csvkit</a>, which is a collection of utilities that support:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>cleaning CSV files to resolve syntax errors</li>\n<li>viewing and searching CSV files to extract relevant data</li>\n<li>generating summaries of columns in the data</li>\n<li>merging together CSV files, joining them based on common column values</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://csvkit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial/getting_started.html\">getting started guide</a> introduces you to each of the tools in turn. Taken together they provide a quick way to inspect the data in a set of CSV files and then combine them to create a more useful structure.</p>\n<p>However, if you need to do more detailed clean-up then <a href=\"http://csvfix.byethost5.com/csvfix15/csvfix.html\">csvfix</a> might be a better alternative. The documentation includes some <a href=\"http://csvfix.byethost5.com/csvfix15/SolutionstoCommonProblems.html\">solutions to common problems</a> which gives a good overview of the functionality. csvfix is particularly good at tidying up and reformatting fields within a CSV file making it a good complement to csvkit.</p>\n<p>Of course data is often published as an Excel file rather than as CSV, often requiring a manual step to convert it to CSV before applying other tools. Data might also be spread across separate worksheets, making the export process more laborious. I wrote the <a href=\"https://github.com/ldodds/xls-split\">xls-split</a> utility to help extract worksheets from Excel files, converting them into one or more CSV files. Its very useful for extracting data from a set of related spreadsheets, e.g. annual or monthly statistics, in order to then build an aggregate data file.</p>\n<p>Validating data in a CSV file, to check that it conforms to expectations, is another common task. This is something that we've been looking at in more depth at the ODI. This <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/csv-validation-research\">github project</a> and the related documentation explores various tools and approaches for validating CSV files against simple schemas.</p>\n<p>If working on the command-line isn't your thing then <a href=\"http://openrefine.org/\">OpenRefine</a> is still one of the best tools for interactively tidying up messy data.</p>\n<p>What other tools do you use when working with CSV files?

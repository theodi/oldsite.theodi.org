Where can we find it? Why should we think about designing services with it? What methods and processes can we use? Artists <a href=\"http://www.kasiamolga.net/\">Kasia Molga</a> and <a href=\"http://fabiolattanziantinori.com/\">Fabio Lattanzi Antinori</a> then presented their own data driven artworks, providing further insights into creative uses of data.</p>\n<p>A working lunch was next: our task was to identify problems or opportunities relating to the environment, education, business and commerce, finance, transport, or health and well-being. We then formed 5 teams around the identified issues, and were asked to design a service or product that would use open data to address them. The afternoon was spent furiously working to identify and describe our users, their needs, the data we might use and our proposed solutions. This is what the teams came up with:</p>\n<p><strong>Serendipity</strong> - a service that enables people to trade their skills and experience instead of relying on money, using data created through endorsements.</p>\n<p><strong>Skool of Different Thoughts</strong> - a vision for the future of education, where teaching models are designed around the different learning styles and values of children.</p>\n<p><strong>Bank of Trust</strong> - A design for a future where knowledge is prescribed by the NHS and trust becomes the new currency.</p>\n<p><strong>Flockr</strong> - a mobile app designed to help partially sighted people navigate the city, using open street maps, gps and user generated data.</p>\n<p><strong>Echo n</strong> - a service that removes space debris by enablng customers to bid for it through online trading.</p>\n<p>Finally, the teams pitched their ideas to <a href=\"http://theodi.org/team/gavin-starks\">Gavin Starks</a>, the ODI's CEO, <a href=\"http://theodi.org/team/ulrich-atz\">Ulrich Atz</a>, Head of Statistics, and curator <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShiriShalmy\">Shiri Shalmy</a>, and after some deliberation, the prize went to the Flockr team.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/3c/53873cf61f986a085f000028/Untitled-1.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"53873cf6d0d4620810000003\"> </p>\n<p>It was an energetic, thought provoking day, with a high level of intellectual rigour demonstrated by UALâ€™s students. This is encouraging, because as Chris says, it is their responsibility to understand the properties and affordances of open data, so they can begin forging the iconic products and services of the future. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/3c/53873c0af362be294500003e/image_2.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"53873c0a1f986a085b000068\"></p>\n<p>This event was organised by artist and PhD student Charlotte Webb <a href=\"https://twitter.com/otheragent\">@otheragent</a> <a href=\"http://www.otheragents.net\">www.otheragents.net</a></p>\n<p><em>For more information about Restless Futures visit the <a href=\"http://www.arts.ac.uk/csm/csm-culture/restless-futures/\">CSM website</a>, or search for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/restlessfutures?src=hash\">#restlessfutures</a> on Twitter.

The World Health Organisation <a href=\"http://www.who.int/nutgrowthdb/publications/overweight_obesity/en/\">estimates</a> that 12.7% of African children will be obese by 2020, compared with 8.5% in 2010. But the <a href=\"https://www.wits.ac.za/dphru/african-centre-for-obesity-prevention/\">African Centre for Obesity Prevention (Action)</a> is on a mission to prevent and manage this through evidence-based action. </p>\n<p>Based at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, Action is focused on summarising and disseminating data and trends in obesity to the public, government and media, and encouraging lifestyle change to prevent and manage obesity across the continent.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/fb/a3/56fba310f362be088800000f/candy.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img text-center\" id=\"56fba3101f986a07cc000031\">\n<small>Childhood obesity has increased dramatically in the past 25 years. <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" title=\"CC BY 2.0\">CC BY 2.0</a>, uploaded by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/luigi_and_linda/6516239999/in/photolist-aVPr8v-cf5HKE-fp29Hc-b8Efzr-d34G4m-rUxFtA-a2CGid-nNVvUL-g4Nc22-akWFoN-8FCU8N-qg232o-eSX6e5-9NEDvG-zFaNqe-igSjfe-9XVr44-5FLNPC-bEmxbH-bsQeXt-boqvHa-deqprm-pjite1-6iYM4f-a1nc1q-rpwFXd-9tbL37-E9gLgD-qCHfP4-byqbWS-qdnvKH-9atDJH-59Ex8Z-oGWCQ5-5dd5PV-bR2JU6-atxqfo-z4TFnH-deqrxt-oEAQxC-dB2Fdi-eaKs6m-vUCN5Q-aaR9Af-fqozE-4xQP1C-7WztNx-oVvsrQ-fGc6e2-6dtCR7\" title=\"Luigi Guarino\">Luigi Guarino</a>.</small></p>\n<h3 id=\"2mappingfoodinsecurity\">2. <strong>Mapping food insecurity</strong></h3>\n<p>Reliable information is critical to understanding food security trends, assessing crises and informing decision-making. However, according to <a href=\"http://www.alnap.org/resource/21596\">a report by ALNAP</a>, traditional methods for collecting this information – in particular food security data at household level – are often expensive, slow and cumbersome, which limits its effective use for decision-making.</p>\n<p>The UN World Food Programme’s Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (VAM) team is collecting food security data remotely. They’re collecting through short phone surveys, SMS, live telephone interviews and an interactive voice response system. This data is then presented through an <a href=\"http://vam.wfp.org/\">open access website</a> and <a href=\"http://vam.wfp.org/mvam_monitoring/databank_fcs.aspx\">open databank.</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"3discoveringthetruthaboutyoghurt\">3. <strong>Discovering the truth about yoghurt</strong></h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.yogurtinnutrition.com/about-us/\">Yoghurt in Nutrition Initiative</a> is a multi-year global, collaborative project to uncover scientific data related to yoghurt and identify gaps in our understanding of its health effects. </p>\n<p>This project is led by the Danone Institute International in collaboration with the American Society for Nutrition and International Osteoporosis Foundation, which aims to evaluate the current evidence base on the nutritional impact of yoghurt. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/fb/a5/56fba555d0d4625e1300000b/yoghurt.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img text-center\" id=\"56fba554f362be07fc00002b\">\n<small>It's still healthy if it's mostly yoghurt, right? <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" title=\"CC BY 2.0\">CC BY 2.0</a>, uploaded by [cyclonebill](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cyclonebill/4776711227/in/photolist-8h6TQ8-8cspt9-sBmvuu-6EbT4A-b8waan-5JAJA7-6EbRYQ-dUgUFo-8swzf2-7NwEdD-isi5Q-7hdDJi-2piwrZ-brdUhS-bW5BhA-91UXV1-4XwC7N-eYCgS9-57XwhZ-5jxjf-DvZk3-7VNTFz-aQHZz-ffhGoT-4onH9R-chRzP-dgL9Nw-4sTDy2-4sTDuF-dCXiL3-ckT823-8pk3zP-6AgjiC-n3Cbdg-8PprjG-87fpEg-3ZDCUb-7w4ZWr-8pk3yX-8pok4b-4HfoX6-9DJxdF-8pk9oH-9LYMKp-59rKXk-ckT92Y-suQdBv-8pkfHB-8pkfHZ-akJBwS “cyclonebill\").</small></p>\n<h3 id=\"4mappingandmonitoringwaterandsanitationsites\">4. <strong>Mapping and monitoring water and sanitation sites</strong></h3>\n<p>A nonprofit tech startup has created an app for mobile phone users to instantly test and analyse water quality from local sources and share this information on their global, open-source water monitoring database.</p>\n<p>Dedicated to creating world changing technologies for water and health, <a href=\"http://www.mwater.co/about.html\">mWater</a> has over 6,000 free users in 59 countries.

Our Head of Robots, <a href=\"http://theodi.org/team/sam-pikesley\">Sam Pikesley</a>, has found a creative way to track his own diabetes. He’s developed an <a href=\"http://sam.pikesley.org/projects/correctiondose/\">app</a>, optimised for his own mobile, which records his blood glucose, medication, carbs and more. </p>\n<p>Sam says: </p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I find that the best way of dealing with my condition is to (attempt to) master it, and for me that means tracking everything about it. I have used various smartphone apps in the past, but none of them were ever quite right for me, and this is about dealing with ​my​ diabetes, so I built this thing. I have basically put an API on my own pancreas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Hannah Foulds is a <a href=\"http://theodi.org/team/hannah-foulds\">Digital Marketing Manager</a>, and Anna Scott is <a href=\"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott\">Writer / Editor</a> at the ODI.

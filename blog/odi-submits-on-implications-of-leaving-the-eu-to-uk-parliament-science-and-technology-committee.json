Our current projects include work on the <a href=\"http://www.europeandataportal.eu/\">European Data Portal</a>, the <a href=\"https://edsa-project.eu/\">European Data Science Academy</a>, <a href=\"http://odedu-project.eu/\">Open Data Education</a> and <a href=\"http://opendataincubator\">ODINE</a>, a European incubator for open data startups. </p>\n<p>Our submission is based on our experience in the UK, the EU and across the world, as well as our awareness of the strategic importance and value of <a href=\"http://theodi.org/data-infrastructure\">data infrastructure</a>.</p>\n<p>Roads help us navigate to a location. Data helps us navigate to a decision. For our essential data infrastructure to have maximum value for governments, business and citizens, it needs to be as open and accessible as possible, while maintaining privacy. </p>\n<p>We have highlighted risks and opportunities that have an impact on the UK’s data-related capability and innovation, and those that might be mitigated using open data and open access.</p>\n<iframe style=\"max-width:100%; width:790px; height:770px;\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1By5gJs9iUHJLaDlpUYA8EIgY5h-t6qkRNtDqB0b-7dM/pub?embedded=true\"></iframe>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Peter Wells","slug":"peter-wells","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/peter-wells","tag_ids":["writers","writer"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/data-knows-no-boundaries.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/data-knows-no-boundaries","slug":"data-knows-no-boundaries","title":"Data knows no boundaries","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-06-24T15:35:45+00:00","created_at":"2016-06-24T09:43:00+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","open-data","europe","politics"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/we-need-to-strengthen-our-data-infrastructure.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/we-need-to-strengthen-our-data-infrastructure","slug":"we-need-to-strengthen-our-data-infrastructure","title":"We need to strengthen our data infrastructure","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-01-11T09:50:28+00:00","created_at":"2016-01-08T12:35:12+00:00","tag_ids":["page","data-infrastructure"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Peter Wells","slug":"peter-wells","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/peter-wells","tag_ids":["writers","writer"]}}

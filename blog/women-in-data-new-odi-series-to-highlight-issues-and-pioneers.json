As well as the barriers this suggests for entry and progression in the industry, it also raises a wider cultural issue around the representation of women in historical data.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199654345.001.0001/acprof-9780199654345-chapter-11\">Charlotte Brewer’s paper on Samuel Johnson’s Dictionary</a>, she identified that, out of a total of around 140,000 quotations, fewer than 30 were from female writers. This landmark tone of 1755 defined women and women’s topics almost entirely, then, by their relationship to men. </p>\n<p>In the modern age, Wikipedia, the world’s largest encyclopedia, is driven predominantly by men; <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/opinion/can-wikipedia-survive.html?_r=0\">in 2011 less than 15% of its editors were women.</a> This means that women are almost certainly under-represented in the site’s entries and perpetuates a problem with data about women throughout history. As <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/15/wikipedia-gender-racial-bias_n_7054550.html\">Sara Boboltz wrote in the Huffington Post</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...there’s simply less documentation on many accomplished women and minorities throughout history – they were often ignored, after all, or forced to make their contributions as someone else’s assistant. That makes demonstrating why they deserve a mention on the Internet’s ‘sum of all human knowledge’ more difficult.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In light of what I see as a situation that requires positive action, we at the ODI have decided to launch a ‘Women in data’ or, perhaps more correctly, a ‘Women and data’ series. Along with data issues that concern women – from outdated NHS maternity record keeping to gender bias in health trackers – the series will highlight the issues that women working in the industry face and showcase the pioneering women and initiatives that are trying to address them. It complements the work that our board member <a href=\"https://theodi.org/team/martha-lane-fox-baroness-lanefox-of-soho\">Martha Lane Fox</a> is doing at <a href=\"https://doteveryone.org.uk/\">Dot Everyone</a>, which a specific focus on women in tech. </p>\n<p>We would also like to foster a debate around women’s historical and cultural representation, in line with our mission as an institute and allied with our <a href=\"https://theodi.org/culture\">‘Data as Culture’</a> programme. Lucy Crompton-Reid, the CEO of Wikimedia UK, will be discussing the subject of women’s representation on Wikipedia at a <a href=\"http://theodi.org/events\">Friday lunchtime lecture</a> on 6 May, which I would encourage you to attend. Details will be posted in due course.</p>\n<p>After Lucy’s lecture in May, we will be publishing a regular series of blogs and I invite you to email <a href=\"mailto:stories@theodi.org\">stories</a><a href=\"mailto:stories@theodi.org\">@theodi.org</a> with ideas for topics you would like us to cover, with details of those pioneering women and initiatives we could feature, and with feedback on what we have written and spoken about. </p>\n<p>As a feminist and a manager in this industry, I feel very strongly about women’s representation and look forward to your contributions to help us effect change.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Laura Davis is a <a href=\"http://theodi.org/team/laura-davis\">Head of Content and Production</a> at the ODI.

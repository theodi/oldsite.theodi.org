Sam's <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/blog/better-living-through-openness\">blog post</a> at the end of the week brought in a bunch more. It's so great to see the channel with people in it; it's easy to say 'we're going to have an open IRC channel', but to have people in it who aren't us is incredibly satisfying. \u0002<a href=\"http://theodi.org/people/tom-heath\">Tom</a>\u0002mainly spent last week bootstrapping his Ruby skills, as it's going to be our language of choice. His summary: \"I thought this was just for hipsters, but it's actually really good\". He's getting on well with it, but rather disturbed that other people have already found his code (the scary part of working in public). \u0002<a href=\"http://theodi.org/people/sam-pikesley\">Sam</a> has been wrestling with various infrastructure projects, and <a href=\"https://github.com/Atalanta/cucumber-chef/issues/96\">swearing at horrible dependency problems</a> in the latest version of <a href=\"https://github.com/Atalanta/cucumber-chef\">cucumber-chef</a>. \u0002<a href=\"http://theodi.org/people/james-smith\">I</a> was busy building things like our <a href=\"https://www.leftronic.com/share/g/OqF269\">tech team metrics dashboard</a>, getting it up on <a href=\"https://twitpic.com/bzpz2n\">a screen in the office</a>, and getting our <a href=\"http://jenkins.theodi.org/\">Jenkins server</a> to do what we want it to do in terms of continuous integration and deployment. \u0002<a href=\"http://theodi.org/people/jeni\">Jeni</a>'s been in charge of the whole place this week, which has kept her plenty busy, on top of writing stories for our first sprint. \u0002We also all sat down for a discussion on URI design and versioning. As a developer unwise in the esoterica of these things, I was surprised to discover that it can be <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/group/track/issues/14\">rather controversial</a>. However, we all managed to agree on our approach without coming to blows. The result can wait for another blog post though... \u0002All in all we're pretty much ready to go. In week #19 we start building things that <em>other</em> people want! </p>","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"James Smith","slug":"james-smith","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/james-smith","tag_ids":["team","rnd-programme","research-and-development","odi-labs"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"James Smith","slug":"james-smith","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/james-smith","tag_ids":["team","rnd-programme","research-and-development","odi-labs"]}}

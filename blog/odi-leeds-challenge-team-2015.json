Then we’ll give you a quote to deliver the outcome.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you’re happy with our quote we’ll assemble a team with the skills and experience needed to deliver your project. Different challenges will call for different skills. We’re confident that we can find great people..</p></li>\n<li><p>You receive a guaranteed outcome from a global brand that you can trust to be good with data. Instead of paying multiple people in different ways you’ll get a single invoice from the ODI Leeds.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"projectdelivery\">Project delivery</h3>\n<p>We’ve already had a lot of interest. In our current projects we’re helping overcome commercial and technical barriers to making valuable data about the Leeds City Region open. We’re prototyping new systems that use open data to increase the efficiency of a local social enterprise. We’re collecting, mapping and visualising data about our region to encourage investment and job creation. When we’ve finished, we’ll be sharing our achievements online here, in real life at the ODI Leeds, and globally via the ODI network.</p>\n<p><strong>If you have an idea, we’d love to hear about it.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Contact Paul <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulcconnell\">@Paulcconnell</a> / Paul@actuatedfutures.com or Tom <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thomasforth\">@thomasforth</a> / thomas.forth@gmail.com.</em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Paul Connell","slug":"paul-connell","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/paul-connell","tag_ids":["writers","writer"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Paul Connell","slug":"paul-connell","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/paul-connell","tag_ids":["writers","writer"]}}

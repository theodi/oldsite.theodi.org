The first fruits of this work will be a joint event presented with Seedcamp in London on 19 November at Campus London: <a href=\"http://seedcamp.com/events/seedcamp-x-opendata/\" title=\"Seedcamp x Open Data\">Seedcamp x Open Data</a>.</p>\n<p>Seedcamp is one of Europe's most prominent acceleration programmes so we're proud that they've thrown their weight behind an event focusing on open data startups.</p>\n<p>The event's format will be similar to other 'mini Seedcamps'. From a group of applicants, Seedcamp and the ODI will jointly select 10 startups to pitch their ideas on-stage to a panel of experts, who will then ask questions. We'll follow that up with a reception and networking session. </p>\n<p>Besides getting exposure at the event, participants may be selected to go on to attend a full Seedcamp week and join the Seedcamp programme. ODI staff will also be on-hand to answer any questions on the the ODI Startup programme and the <a href=\"https://theodi.org/open-data-incubator-for-europe\" title=\"Open Data Incubator for Europe (ODInE)\">Open Data Incubator for Europe (ODInE)</a>.</p>\n<p><em>If you're a startup working with open data and you'd like to pitch your idea, please apply to pitch via <a href=\"https://angel.co/seedcamp-seedcamp-x-opendata-9th-oct/apply\" title=\"Angel List\">Angel List</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em>If you want to come along and hear about what some great startups are doing with open data, please <a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/seedcamp-x-opendata-tickets-18431695698\" title=\"register with EventBrite\">register with EventBrite</a> and join us.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Daniel Appelquist is Startup Ambassador-at-large at the ODI.

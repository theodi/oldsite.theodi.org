Doing this repeatably, reliably and efficiently is a challenge. After reviewing the many existing tools that tackle aspects of this problem, Swirrl concluded that none of them were quite the right match for this job, so decided that it was time to develop a new Linked Data ETL tool set.</p>\n<p><em>You can read more about <a href=\"http://blog.swirrl.com/articles/linked-data-etl/\">the design decisions behind Grafter</a> in <a href=\"http://project.dapaas.eu/dapaas-partner-biographies/dapaas-partner-rick-moynihan\">Rick Moynihan's</a> article on the Swirrl blog.</em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Bill Roberts ","slug":"dapaas-partner-bill-roberts","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/dapaas-partner-bill-roberts","tag_ids":["dapaas","partner-biography"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Bill Roberts ","slug":"dapaas-partner-bill-roberts","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/dapaas-partner-bill-roberts","tag_ids":["dapaas","partner-biography"]}}

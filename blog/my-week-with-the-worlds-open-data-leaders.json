During the week I studied different open data concepts, and whitepapers from leading countries in open data. In my capacity as Deputy Head of the State Agency for e-Governance in Ukraine, I now have a clear understanding of what I want to change in <a href=\"http://iportal.rada.gov.ua/en/news/News/page/en/news/News/107410.html\">Ukrainian law</a>, and how to finalise our open data roadmap and improve <a href=\"http://data.gov.ua/\">data.gov.ua</a>.</p>\n<p>On one of the days I was put in a small group with other open data leaders to identify and overcome common challenges. I was lucky to be placed in a group with representatives from India, Italy and Serbia. Italy’s challenges, I heard, involved agriculture, tourism, fashion and food (lots of tasty Italian food was mentioned); India drew attention to government services and medicine; and Serbia and Ukraine seemed to have a lot of work to do, from raising awareness to increasing transparency. </p>\n<p>The leaders collaborated and came up with new ideas for promoting open data, which I’ll now be working to implement in Ukraine. But I intend for our cooperation to continue and develop with a constant exchange of knowledge, ideas and sharing of results.</p>\n<p>The inspiration and new energy that this week brought out in me has been very valuable. In spite of having experienced resistance to open data among central authorities in Ukraine – which had greatly undermined my confidence – my week at the Open Data Leaders Network helped me to recharge.</p>\n<p>Frankly, I miss the peers I met. Because spending a week among team of leaders is a unique experience – each devoted to the cause of developing open data – and willing to share their perspectives and support each other.</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Hannah Foulds","slug":"hannah-foulds","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/hannah-foulds","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme","odi-team"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-data-leaders-network-open-call-2016.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/open-data-leaders-network-open-call-2016","slug":"open-data-leaders-network-open-call-2016","title":"Open Data Leaders Network: an open call for outstanding government leaders - 2016","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-07-01T11:21:20+00:00","created_at":"2016-07-01T10:37:37+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","open-data-leaders-network","open-data-leaders","series-open-data-leaders"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Hannah Foulds","slug":"hannah-foulds","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/hannah-foulds","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme","odi-team"]}}

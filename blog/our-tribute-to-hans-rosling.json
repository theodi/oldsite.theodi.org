Most people base their ideas about the world on what they learned at school, but that gets out of date very quickly. He taught me to never assume that I know what the world looks like, and always be ready for new information</p>\n<p><strong>Lucy Knight, ODI Devon</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/9d/a1/589da106f362be08bf000005/Lucy-small.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img pull-left\" id=\"589da1061f986a07d4000023\"> The first time I saw one of Hans Rosling’s TED talks, I realised that it’s OK to be excited about data and the things it makes possible; it’s OK to talk about data, statistics and technology as if you really care about the results; it’s OK to speed up and down a stage and wave your arms and make the audience laugh</p>\n<p><br>\n<strong>Amanda Smith, Account Manager</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/9d/a1/589da106d0d46207df000009/Amanda_small.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img pull-left\" id=\"589da106d0d462064b00002c\"> Hans Rosling combined data and storytelling to show me that there's much positivity in this world, and things aren't as bleak as often we imagine. He was someone you could look to for the truth, and would get you excited about the possibilities and opportunities to learn from data and create change. Hans also reminded me that it’s great to be a data geek</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie Fawcett, Researcher</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/9d/a1/589da107d0d46207df00000b/square_jamie-small.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img pull-left\" id=\"589da107d0d462064b00002d\"> I first came across Hans Rosling during a university statistics course. His charismatic, engaging style seemed to clash violently with all my experiences of statistics to that date. By presenting data about the real world in easily accessible ways, he helped me to understand the potential power of strong statistics and clear communication</p>\n<p><strong>Anne McCrossan, ODI Cornwall</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/9d/a1/589da1091f986a0851000005/Anne_McCrossan-small.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img pull-left\" id=\"589da109d0d462064b00002e\"> I think of Hans Rosling as the godfather of data enablement, he brought data to life in the most palpable way, with exciting narrative, interactive visuals and a disarmingly down-to earth approach. Hans made data wrangling an irresistible and accessible joy. He was just a huge inspiration and life is poorer without him.</p>\n<p><br>\n<em><strong>If you have ideas or experience in open data that you’d like to share, <a href=\"mailto:production@theodi.org\">pitch us a blog</a> or tweet us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/odihq\">@ODIHQ</a></strong></em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}}

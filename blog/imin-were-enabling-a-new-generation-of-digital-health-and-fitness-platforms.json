Our early research into other sectors empowered by open data was what excited us initially; the possibilities offered by open data were seemingly endless. However, the most excited we've been about open data was back in November 2014 when we presented <a href=\"https://bethnalgreenventures.com/\">Bethnal Green Ventures</a> (imin’s first investors and backers) with a single piece of A4 paper illustrating our vision for a physical activity sector empowered by open data. </p>\n<p><strong>What are the biggest challenges you face in your work?</strong></p>\n<p>Honestly, saying 'no' to things. We’ve been privileged to work with some amazing people and organisations, and we're constantly presented with opportunities to work in different ways to get people more active. We’d love to be able to say yes to every opportunity that comes our way, but we have to be careful to remain focused on our milestones and what we need to do to get there. We’re out and about advocating open data and meeting new people as much as we can, but at the same time we’re not afraid of hibernating when needs must.</p>\n<p><strong>What kind of open data would you like to see more of?</strong></p>\n<p>Given the power of open data and the collaboration it encourages, all sectors can benefit in some shape or form from more data being open. But from an imin point of view, we’d like to see more open physical activity data. </p>\n<p>This can be data on anything from an empty squash courts or yoga classes to walking or running groups. The more providers – large and small, public and private – that make their physical activity data open, the easier it will be for innovation that will ultimately benefit the end-consumer. We recommend you check out the <a href=\"http://www.openactive.io/\">OpenActive website</a> for more information on open data in the physical activity sector.</p>\n<p><strong>What are you most looking forward to about the ODI Summit and Awards?</strong></p>\n<p>We’re looking forward to the opening and closing ceremonies. A couple of the imin team were at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny0BWQNOUIk\">ODI Summit 2015</a> and found the keynote speeches at the start and call to action at the end of the day tremendously inspiring. They've since motivated the imin team to continue working tirelessly to make a change. </p>\n<p><em>The awards will be held on 1 November 2016 at the BFI Southbank.

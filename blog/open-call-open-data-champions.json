participants with tools and knowledge to be effective leaders in open data. </p>\n<p>The programme draws on several of the ODI’s successful training courses, and enables participants to learn from outstanding peers and develop their leadership and communication skills.</p>\n<p>During three-day programme in London we will focus on three core problem areas typically faced by open data leaders.</p>\n<p><strong>Targeting users – who is your audience?</strong></p>\n<p>The first day will focus on finding and targeting user communities, with practical sessions on how to prioritise and reach different audiences, and interactive sessions with a variety of user types. </p>\n<p><strong>Open data leadership – what do you want to tell them?</strong></p>\n<p>The second day will draw on international examples of best practice and the latest thinking in change management, and include peer-learning sessions to help participants solve specific problems they face.</p>\n<p><strong>Talking about open data – how do you communicate it?</strong> </p>\n<p>On the final day, participants will build their communication skills, producing their own content, learning to tailor it to different audiences, and delivering pitches.</p>\n<p>To get a better understanding of the type of training we offer, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/138315918\">watch our short film</a> about the <a

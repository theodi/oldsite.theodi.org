Through <a href=\"https://theodi.org/news/open-data-leaders-odi-publishes-method-paper-on-how-to-create-and-sustain-peer-network\">tested peer-to-peer methodology</a>, the programme aims to provide the necessary knowledge and tools for effective open data leadership, and to give leaders access to a network of outstanding peers to share ideas and support over time. </p>\n<p>The programme hopes to sustain lasting relationships among open data leaders. Participants will take part in a programme that blends carefully selected face-to-face and online engagements that finetune their leadership and change management skills, and helps channel their training into open data initiatives at home. </p>\n<p>Launched in February 2015, the programme started with 14 participants from countries including the UK, Chile, Morocco and Macedonia. </p>\n<p>Despite living in different countries, ODLN participants often share similar roadblocks and opportunities in their government work. More than a network of committed leaders, it has become a community of friends, <a href=\"https://theodi.org/blog/open-data-leaders-in-government-finally-have-a-support-network-each-other\">according to Paul Stone</a>, New Zealand’s Open Government Data programme leader and a former participant. “Friends who share the same passion about open data, and who are striving to impact the culture of the governments we work for.” </p>\n<p>This year, the ODI will award a selection of fully and partially funded places for outstanding government leaders. Selected leaders will have a clear record of successful leadership and involvement in the implementation of national, regional or city open data initiatives. </p>\n<p>For more information about the ODLN, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/138315918\">watch our short film</a> and <a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/open-data-leaders-in-government-finally-have-a-support-network-each-other\">read a blog</a> written by one of our former participants. </p>\n<h3 id=\"whatweoffer\">What we offer</h3>\n<p>Through its 10 places for government leaders involved in open data, the ODLN offers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A one-week, peer-to-peer, stimulating programme in London, between 5 September and 9 September, 2016</li>\n<li>The opportunity to apply for a mini-grant valued at up to £6,500 to enhance an open data initiative</li>\n<li>Executive coaching from relevant ODI experts </li>\n<li>Monthly online meetups for the duration of the programme with ODI specialists, co-led with ODLN members for a period of up to six months</li>\n<li>A platform to showcase work at international events, such as the International Open Data Conference and the ODI Summit</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"whatwelookfor\">What we look for</h3>\n<p>Strong applicants for the ODLN programme will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hold a key position within government, having demonstrated experience in implementing a municipal, regional or national open data agenda </li>\n<li>Think creatively and share innovative ideas about the future of open data in their respective cities, regions or countries</li>\n<li>Be prepared to gain from peer-to-peer knowledge and idea sharing</li>\n<li>Demonstrate commitment to joining a high-impact leadership programme, over a sustained period of time</li>\n<li>Demonstrate their willingness to transform the lessons learned through the ODLN into positive change for their respective governments and communities</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"funding\">Funding</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Partially funded places will be available for applicants from the European Union and <a href=\"https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519\">high-income economies</a> (the ODI will cover programme costs only)</li>\n<li>Fully funded places will be available for applicants from <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DAC%20List%20of%20ODA%20Recipients%202014%20final.pdf\">least developed countries low-income countries, lower-middle-income countries and upper-middle-income countries</a> (the ODI will cover programme costs, travel and accommodation). </li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"keydates\">Key dates:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The application process closes on 20 July, 2016 at 17:00 GMT</li>\n<li>Successful applicants will be notified by 27 July, 2016</li>\n<li>Selected participants will be invited to attend the Open Data Leaders Network from <strong>5 September to 9 September, 2016</strong> at the ODI’s offices in London</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"howtoapply\">How to apply:</h3>\n<p>Interested leaders can [download the application form here](\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/106ACiU49yY83e_KWejpBItbwRrTLUZLlRzia2EuruXs/viewform).

The workshop brought together senior representatives from government, industry and the open data community, to share views on the potential vision and responsibilities for a Chief Data Officer for the UK.</p>\n<p>The ODI’s Open Data Roadmap, launched in December 2014, highlights the need for strategic data leadership and recommends the appointment of a CDO who would, as part of their role, “monitor and seek the publication of open data.” The UK Government <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/efficiency-and-reform-in-the-next-parliament\" title=\"Efficiency and Reform in the Next Parliament\">announced their intention</a> to appoint a CDO for the UK public sector alongside the 2014 Autumn Statement, and preparations for the establishment of this role are already well underway inside government.</p>\n<p>The ODI’s workshop teased out considerations that might go into the appointment of a CDO for the UK public sector, drawing on expertise both inside and outside government. </p>\n<p>We captured the range of discussions in a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/theodi.org/document/d/1asZ_9Bt6Xg99m_JDbNfxKrpUzVvwiwyiSwP7rIM0lGk/edit#\">draft briefing note</a> that we’re publishing here to get your feedback.

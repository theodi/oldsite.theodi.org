Many of the ingredients exist for a bright future for open data in the country. </p>\n<p>From the 2009 release of transport data to a mass adopted smart phone app (8m downloads), enhancing the use of public transport for Seoul citizens was a start that in many ways mirrors the early open data days in London and the UK. What has followed is the most senior of government and agency support from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_House\">‘blue house’</a> and President Park Geun-hye, implementation leadership and support from the <a href=\"http://eng.nia.or.kr/english/eng_nia.asp\">Korean NIA </a>and a community of open data activists both inside and out of government. Meeting companies both large and small in a single evening, in an informal environment, it is clear that there is industry appetite matched by government support to build upon the commendable foundations that have been laid.  </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/4d/50/534d500bf362be6c8700015a/logo-new.png\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img pull-right\" id=\"534d500bf362be2ece000009\"> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/CxYhudxfkl8\">Gov 3.0</a> is an audacious vision. Drawing parallels to the UK’s own Government digital services mission, the Korean administration recognizes the huge opportunity digital government has to transform citizens experience of, access to, and interaction with government. Both programmes enlist open data at their core and the NIA is clearly iterating their open data strategy and data releases in line with the demands and needs of both citizens and businesses. </p>\n<p>A huge thank you to our local ODI node <a href=\"http://www.saltlux.com/\">Saltlux</a> and to representatives from the Korean NIA. Both filled my time in the capital with insightful and relevant experiences. I very much hope the 250+ companies already making, using and requesting the data are just the start for more compelling industry stories of data driving value back to businesses and citizens.</p>\n<p>Our team here in London and our wider global network look forward to continued, and more in depth collaboration with the NIA, Saltlux and the wide open data community in Korea.  </p>\n<p>Surely the stage is set in 2014 for Korea to ascend well past its already highly respectable placing of <a href=\"http://theodi.github.io/open-data-barometer-viz/\">12th</a> in the<a href=\"http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2013/11/116_146572.html\"> open data barometer league tables</a>. Open data has a bright future in Korea.  </p>\n<p>We are excited to build activities on the <a href=\"http://www.futuregov.asia/articles/2014/feb/18/open-data-institute-announces-five-new-internation/\">2013 memorandum of understanding made between our governments and team</a>s and look forward to hosting open data leaders from Korea in London later in 2014.</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-node-knowledge-feb-2014.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-node-knowledge-feb-2014","slug":"odi-node-knowledge-feb-2014","title":"Node knowledge - Feb 2014","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:54:50+00:00","created_at":"2014-02-22T21:35:57+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/node-knowledge-november-2013.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/node-knowledge-november-2013","slug":"node-knowledge-november-2013","title":"Node Knowledge… November 2013","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-03-02T10:28:39+00:00","created_at":"2013-11-18T17:58:57+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","nodes","network","global","gavin-starks"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/about-nodes.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/about-nodes","slug":"about-nodes","title":"ODI Nodes","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-07-06T08:45:31+00:00","created_at":"2013-10-23T11:22:16+00:00","tag_ids":["page","node","nodes","international"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{}}

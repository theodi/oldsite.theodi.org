They give a set of practical recommendations for open data publishers so that they can make an informed choice about what and how to publish and support their open data.</p>\n<p><strong>What is an Open Data Certificate?</strong></p>\n<p>A certificate measures the quality of your open data. Unlike other standards, it goes beyond just the technical aspects of open data to look holistically at your open data “as-a-service”.</p>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/about\">four levels</a> against which you can measure your dataset. By going through a simple questionnaire process, you will get:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A set of practical guides on how you can improve your quality of your open data</li>\n<li>A certificate for your open data, which also doubles up as a quick reference sheet for your dataset for the re-users</li>\n<li>An embeddable badge to showcase your Open Data Certificate, acting as a recognisable quality mark</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How can you help?</strong></p>\n<p>Led by the ODI North Carolina Node, we have been busy localising the certificate so that it reflects and incorporates the specific regulatory and legal requirements in the US jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>We now need you to participate by assessing your open data using our localised Open Data Certificates. This will help us with quality assurance before the US certification goes live.</p>\n<p><strong>How to start the questionnaire</strong></p>\n<p>Simply follow the steps below to access the localised version of the questionnaire:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/2d/2d/552d2de81f986a08fe00005b/2015-04-14_15-36-42.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"552d2de8f362be213e000086\"></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the questionnaire by going to ‘Create new certificate’</li>\n<li>Click the pencil icon near the the left hand corner</li>\n<li>From the drop-down menu, select ‘United States’</li>\n<li>Click ‘Change jurisdiction’</li>\n<li>The questionnaire should be switched to the US version and it should display its Jurisdiction as US at the top left hand corner</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>How do I feedback?</strong></p>\n<p>Please report any bugs or mistakes, or post general comments about Open Data Certificates using:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/open-data-certificate/issues\">GitHub</a> by raising a new issue; or\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/theodi.org/forms/d/1YC-VliMrsWLmuzDGIKfgZOqPk0JFUKT4xm-tm2PXgIA/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1\">Open Data Certificates user feedback form</a></p>\n<p>Our aim is to deliver a final version of the USA version of Open Data Certificates in June.

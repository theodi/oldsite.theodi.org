How are you doing?</strong></p>\n<p>Hey! I'm looking forward to see all of my open data friends and colleagues at ODI Awards! </p>\n<p><strong>What do you, or your organisation, do in a nutshell?</strong></p>\n<p>I help the ecosystem of civic tech to be built around data in Ukraine. Now government, IT companies and IT volunteers are working on apps together to make a better country. </p>\n<p><strong>What first got you excited about open data?</strong></p>\n<p>At one of our first hackathons I remember that students couldn't rate Kyiv hospitals as they didn't have list addresses. Same issues started to pop up frequently. This was just two years ago. </p>\n<p><strong>What are your biggest data challenges?</strong></p>\n<p>I'm fighting paper everyday. When we will stop using paper to collect and share data, then it's a new world. </p>\n<p><strong>What kind of open data would you like to see more of?</strong></p>\n<p>We just need all of it. More data is always better. You never know who will find some dataset useful.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you feel about being nominated for an open data award?</strong></p>\n<p>It's such a great feeling to realise that you're doing what you like and that some distant people also recognise this. </p>\n<p><em>The <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/\">Open Data Awards</a> will be held on July 9 in partnership with Bloomberg at Bloomberg’s London offices on Finsbury Square.</em></p>\n<p><em>Explore all <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/nominations/\">nominees</a> and <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/2015-finalists/\">finalists</a> and follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ODIAwards\">#ODIAwards</a> for updates on the night.</em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"Open Data Awards","url":"http://awards.theodi.org/"}],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/mo-mcroberts-open-data-anyone-can-use.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/mo-mcroberts-open-data-anyone-can-use","slug":"mo-mcroberts-open-data-anyone-can-use","title":"Mo McRoberts: ‘The best thing about open data is that anyone can use it'","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:02:10+00:00","created_at":"2015-07-08T21:42:43+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","open-data","open-data-awards","bbc"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/announcing-the-2015-open-data-awards-finalists.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/announcing-the-2015-open-data-awards-finalists","slug":"announcing-the-2015-open-data-awards-finalists","title":"Announcing the 2015 Open Data Awards finalists","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:01:44+00:00","created_at":"2015-06-25T12:53:41+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","open-data-awards"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/john-gibson-open-data-improve-regulated-markets.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/john-gibson-open-data-improve-regulated-markets","slug":"john-gibson-open-data-improve-regulated-markets","title":"John Gibson on open data: 'Let's make regulated markets work better'","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:02:27+00:00","created_at":"2015-07-06T15:19:32+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","open-data-awards","business","nesta"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}}

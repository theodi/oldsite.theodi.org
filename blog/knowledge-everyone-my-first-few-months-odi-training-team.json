The format: we host a talk from an expert about the meaning and impact of open data and you bring your lunch and your questions.</p>\n<p>Every Friday at 1pm there’s a great buzz in the office when our attendees turn up and fill our boardroom. It’s been really exciting to see the community grow over the last few months and we now have a large, global network of open data enthusiasts who we connect with both in person and online. \u0002\nA personal favourite was <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/132404337/How-to-create-more-value-from-government-open-data\">David Mitton from Listpoint’s talk </a>on unlocking value from government data. Using the national police database as a case study David showed really clearly how opening up data had helped reduce IT costs via streamlining code lists and outlined the potential savings which could be made in the future.</p>\n<p>I was lucky enough to attend the <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/courses/open-data-practice\">Open Data in Practice</a> training course in July. The best bits were getting my hands dirty with some data mining; taking data sets and cleaning them with Google Refine.</p>\n<p>It helped me appreciate the journey we have to go on to get data presented in a useable and useful format as well as opening it up. I couldn’t believe how much cleaning was required of some datasets which were already in the public domain. It made me realise the huge value of the <a href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/\">ODI Open Data Certificates</a> as a benchmark for open data standards.</p>\n<p>So, in the spirit of openness, here are our first two terms of training in numbers:</p>\n<p>\u0002</p>\n<ul>\n<li>65,665 people browsed our Friday lunchtime lecture slides on<a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/OpenDataInstitute\"> Scribd</a> and <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/theODI\">Slideshare</a></li>\n<li>890 cups coffee drunk at our lectures and courses</li>\n<li>729 people attended our <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures\">Friday lunchtime lectures</a></li>\n<li>324 pieces of sushi consumed</li>\n<li>290 biscuits munched</li>\n<li>86 people trained</li>\n<li>53 <a href=\"http://data.gov.uk/\">data.gov.uk</a> datasets mined</li>\n<li>22 lunchtime lectures hosted</li>\n<li>4 public training courses launched</li>\n<li>And <em>finally</em> some of you (803 to be precise) are starting to listen to our audio content on<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/theodi\"> Soundcloud</a>! \u0002\n\u0002\nI’d personally like to thank the ODI training team, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kcorrick\">Kathryn Corrick</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davetaz\">Dave Tarrant </a>and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/langphil\">Phil Lang</a> for being such brilliant and creative people to work with. I’d also like to thank everyone who’s helped build our open data curriculum from scratch: Les Carr, Max van Kleek, Thomas Wainwright, Francis Davey, Sherree Westwell, Lisa Evans and Ulrich Atz and our 22 lunchtime lecturers. \u0002\n\u0002\nBring on September! \u0002\nAndrea</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u0002\n\u0002</p>","organizations":[],"author":{}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{}}

It also showed the perils if we get it wrong. There are always two sides to every coin.</p>\n<p>The challenge is this: the data that we need is not stored in one, or even a dozen, clearly identifiable systems. It’s embedded in websites, in smartphones, in data centres and now in things. It’s not controlled by one government, one institution or one person. Nor is data universally accessible: some people have data, while others need data. If data is to usher in a more sustainable future, it must first be open data.</p>\n<p>Recognising the challenge, an advisory group to Ban Ki-moon recommended the formation of a multi-stakeholder partnership. It’s a partnership of organisations helping to harness the data revolution to monitor and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. It’s called the <a href=\"http://www.data4sdgs.org/#intro\" title=\"Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data\">Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data</a>. It launched in September and SAP is proud to be a founding member and anchor partner.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://directory.theodi.org/members/AC3231ED\" title=\"SAP\">SAP</a> we are passionate about helping [unlock the potential within data](http://www.virtualrunsimpletour.com/runsimpleseries\n \"unlock the potential within data\").

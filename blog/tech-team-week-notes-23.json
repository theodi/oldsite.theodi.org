Time is going very fast!</p>\n<p>We didn't quite hit everything we wanted to get done in Sprint #2, so <a href=\"http://theodi.org/people/stuart-harrison\">Stuart</a>\u0002and <a href=\"http://theodi.org/people/james-smith\">I</a>\u0002spent the first half of the week finishing that off and launching our <a href=\"http://theodi.org/join-us\">membership signup process</a>. We then\u0002got cracking on building capabilities for our new member directory, which is the main target for Sprint #3.\u0002I also started playing around with a little side project that you'll hopefully hear more of later, when it gets more interesting.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/people/tom-heath\">Tom</a> has been doing architecture thinking on the member directory, which will finally include some actual Open Data(!), and also had some good fun\u0002imagining the future of data for\u0002a potential major partner.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/jeni\">Jeni</a> spent the week talking to large numbers\u0002of\u0002people, both\u0002at the Local Government Association workshop on \"Making Transparency Work for You\", and then\u0002talking about open data\u0002at QCon. She also drafted <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/blog/draft-guides-licensing\">two guides to licensing data</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/people/sam-pikesley\">Sam</a> has been edging us ever-closer to our target\u0002of continuous deployment, via <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/chef-envbuilder\">chef incantations</a>, burnt offerings, <a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/innovating-open\">recursion</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atrocity_Archives\">phase conjugate grammars for extra-dimensional summoning</a>,\u0002and other such dark magic. The rest of us really need to learn what he's done soon, before he accidentally opens a portal into another universe and all our code falls into it.</p>","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"James Smith","slug":"james-smith","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/james-smith","tag_ids":["team","rnd-programme","research-and-development","odi-labs"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"James Smith","slug":"james-smith","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/james-smith","tag_ids":["team","rnd-programme","research-and-development","odi-labs"]}}

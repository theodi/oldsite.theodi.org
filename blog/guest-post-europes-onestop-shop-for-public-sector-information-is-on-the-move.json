For example, new legal documents were published on the platform by some countries in order to inspire others. Over the course of ten years, the ePSI platform published many different reports and articles about open data and related topics. These ranged from the political, with pieces on <a href=\"http://www.epsiplatform.eu/sites/default/files/Open%20Data%20as%20a%20Tool%20to%20Fight%20Corruption.pdf\">open data as a tool to fight corruption</a>, to the technical, with reports around <a href=\"http://www.epsiplatform.eu/content/linked-data-and-government\">linked data</a>. </p>\n<p>We wish to thank the ePSI team for their great work in building such a valuable resource, and since their website has now closed we are delighted to be able to give it a new home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hundredsofepsireportsandblogsadoptedbytheeuropeandataportal\">Hundreds of ePSI reports and blogs adopted by the European Data Portal</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.europeandataportal.eu\">European Data Portal (EDP)</a> harvests the metadata of public sector information available on public data portals across European countries, but also acts as resource base for open data-related reports, blogs and events. </p>\n<p>All the ePSI topic reports are already on the <a href=\"http://www.europeandataportal.eu/en/content/training-library/library/other-reports\">EDP library</a>. This section includes around 80 ePSI topic reports, ranging from national reports to technical or domain-specific content. In the coming month, the library will be expanded to feature about 300 ePSI platform blogs. </p>\n<p>In response to some Member States requesting access the <a href=\"http://www.epsiplatform.eu/content/european-psi-scoreboard\">ePSI Scoreboard</a> – a crowd-sourced initiative that aims to assess open data maturity using 100 indicators – EDP is making the entire method available and easily reproduced via Excel files with indicators and accompanying documentation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"keepingeuropesopendatacommunityalive\">Keeping Europe's open data community alive</h3>\n<p>As well as publishing reports, the EDP focuses on sharing important open data news and events for its growing community. Did you read about <a href=\"http://www.europeandataportal.eu/en/content/it-open-government-week-romania\">Open Government Week in Romania</a>? And did you know <a href=\"http://www.europeandataportal.eu/sites/default/files/march_2016_london_city_data_strategy.pdf\">London has this month released a City Data Strategy</a>?

Do you know about specific open data events in your city or region? Share them with the EDP project team so we can help you promote them.

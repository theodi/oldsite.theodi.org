This round offers a grant of up to £6,500 for one member of the network to create a government-led open data project.</p>\n<p>In the previous round, grants were awarded to three exceptional projects from across Latin America and Africa. One project, Bring Open Data to Your School, will create an app empowering adolescents in Argentina to generate and use data about themselves and their communities. Another project aims to crowdsource zip code polygons in Mexico, filling present gaps in datasets and helping to build Mexico’s data infrastructure. Finally, SabriAgric will map existing farms and produce in Edo State in Nigeria, creating a repository of farmers’ data that will aid decision making in government. </p>\n<p>These winning projects will put open data into action, solving local and global challenges and creating rapid impact. </p>\n<p>In its time supporting successful government-led open data initiatives, the ODI has found three key pillars that help achieve impact: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vision</strong> – projects have a clear social, environmental or economic problem to solve </li>\n<li><strong>Collaboration</strong> – partnering with organisations and individuals within and outside government to succeed, including CSOs, civic tech, developers, researchers, etc</li>\n<li><strong>People focused</strong> – engaging with and meeting the needs of citizens</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"theprogramme\">The programme</h3>\n<p><strong>The ODI’s <a href=\"https://theodi.org/open-data-leaders-network\">Open Data Leaders Network</a></strong> grants programme will offer up to £6,500 to support, develop or amplify a government-led open data project that will create rapid impact. </p>\n<p>Open Data Leaders Network grants are designed to make it easier for open data leaders to pursue practical projects that put open data into action to for social, economic or environmental benefits. </p>\n<h3 id=\"projectsmightinclude\">Projects might include:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>visualisation</strong> of open data that helps to enable better decision making </li>\n<li>Development of a data-driven <strong>tool or app</strong> that enables people to get more value from government open data  </li>\n<li><strong>Community engagement</strong> or activity that gets people involved in using data to address a social issue</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"whattheodiisoffering\">What the ODI is offering</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Up to £6,500</strong> for one member of the Open Data Leaders Network programme to create a government-led open data project in a developing country </li>\n<li><strong>Remote mentoring</strong> on design and implementation</li>\n<li><strong>A platform for leaders</strong> to tell their stories and an opportunity to promote your work</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"applicablecountries\">Applicable countries</h3>\n<p>The grants are available for members of the fourth cohort of the Open Data Leaders Network, from the following list of countries.

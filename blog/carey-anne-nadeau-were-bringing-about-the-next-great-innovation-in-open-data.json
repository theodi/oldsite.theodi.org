What do you do, in a nutshell?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"opendatanation.com\">Open Data Nation</a> is a performance management company working with cities and counties to transform open data into actionable intelligence that makes public services more effective and efficient. ‘Food Inspection Violations, Anticipating Risk’ (FIVAR.org), for example, generates cost savings and keeps the public safer from foodborne illness outbreaks by prioritising restaurant inspections according to risk of a violation.</p>\n<p><strong>What first got you excited about open data?</strong></p>\n<p>At Open Data Nation, we set out to use open data to find wasteful, inefficient spending on public services, like health inspections, traffic safety, homelessness reduction and fire prevention. What we found were a few US cities with innovative open data science-driven approaches and many more cities with similar data and the same problems. With our work, we prove that it is possible to scale best practices. This keeps us motivated to continue growing, reaching more communities, and expanding our impact.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the biggest challenges you face in your work?</strong></p>\n<p>Early on, we learned that the potential market size of our first product, FIVAR, was at least 1500 US county and city governments, but when it came to selling, only early adopters of data-driven decision-making were interested in disruptive civic technologies, even when it meant they could save money and deliver services more effectively. To reach more places and scale our social impact quickly, we’ve learned to build partnerships with incumbent companies and also align private-sector interests, when possible. </p>\n<p><strong>What kind of open data would you like to see more of?</strong></p>\n<p>We’re working to build public-private partnerships that result in the opening up (or free licensing) of private-sector data for the public benefit. For example, we are working to align the interests of restaurants, insurance companies, and departments of health and bring together their data to optimise our predictions of health-code violations and mitigate risk of exposure and death from a foodborne illness outbreak.</p>\n<p><strong>What are you most looking forward to about the ODI Summit and Awards?</strong></p>\n<p>We are always humbled to be in the presence of progressive thinkers in the open data movement. Namely, those who acknowledge what has been accomplished, but also are probing with flashlights into the unknown future of the movement. We are privileged to be a part of this community and working together to create new value and better lives for people, using open data.</p>\n<p><em>The awards will be held on 1 November 2016 at the BFI Southbank.

Our programmes have included the ‘<a href=\"http://theodi.org/open-data-leaders-network\">Open Data Leaders Network</a>’, and <a href=\"http://theodi.org/method-report-lessons-on-supporting-public-sector-open-data-leadership\">in-country support programmes</a>.</p>\n<p>In this time, we’ve learned a lot about what it takes to achieve impact from government-led open data initiatives. </p>\n<p>We have found three key pillars present in successful open data initiatives to help achieve impact:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vision</strong> – open data projects with a clear problem to solve </li>\n<li><strong>Collaboration</strong> – leaders have worked with organisations within and outside government to succeed </li>\n<li><strong>People focused</strong> – often ultimately solving a problem for citizens </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This project helps to make it easier for open data leaders to solve one particular challenge: many leaders have had to lobby government departments to get open data released, and so have created small proof-of-concept projects to create the buy-in needed to scale open data programmes. These programmes are often novel and, although inexpensive, can be hard to fund.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"applyforthegrantsprogramme\">Apply for the grants programme</h3>\n<p><em>The ODI’s Open Data Leaders grants programme will offer up to £6,500 to support, develop or amplify four government-led open data projects that create rapid impact in developing countries</em></p>\n<p><strong>Projects might include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A visualisation of open data that helps to solve problems or enable better decision making </li>\n<li>A data-driven tool for a specific event </li>\n<li>An app that enables people to get more value from government open data  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What we’re offering</strong></p>\n<p>To catalyse impact from government-led open data initiatives, we’re offering:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Up to £6,500 to fund contained a government-led open data project in a developing country </li>\n<li>Remote mentoring </li>\n<li>A platform to tell your story through and opportunities to promote your work</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Judging criteria</strong></p>\n<p>Applicants will be assessed on the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Feasibility</strong> – can they feasibly be completed with the budget provided and within four months of their commission date?</li>\n<li><strong>Solving a problem</strong> – what is their likely impact and what potential subsequent stories can be generated? </li>\n<li><strong>Demonstrated experience within the team</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/theodi.org/forms/d/1v447cM0JCgJryEO5W8ZAc-G1bwze6K_XxGxXX34ewRs/viewform\"><strong>Download application form</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Key dates:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Application closes on <strong>23 May 2016</strong> </li>\n<li>Interviews with shortlisted applicants will take place in the week commencing <strong>30 May 2016</strong> </li>\n<li>Successful applicants will be notified on by <strong>2 June 2016</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please read our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RSBIIB8wSRZuXQMTXom2ESONkJA6p6sRuaA3NPgEEM4/edit\">terms and conditions</a> before applying.</p>\n<p>For further information or questions, please contact <a href=\"mailto:dawn.duhaney@theodi.org\">dawn.duhaney@theodi.org</a>. </p>\n<p><em>These grants are supported by the <a href=\"http://od4d.net/\">Open Data for Development Network</a> (OD4D) programme.

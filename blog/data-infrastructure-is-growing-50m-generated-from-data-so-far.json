As our economy and society continue to become data-driven, we need to address the fact that data is as important as roads, water and energy. The network growing around the ODI includes startups, SMEs, enterprises and individuals in the public and private sectors. Working with our partners and diverse communities, we will continue to support and convene data pioneers, helping them develop open standards, improve data literacy, build trust, address policy, create business models, and tackle challenges that impact everyone. Together, we will help build a strong data infrastructure that enables open innovation – at web scale.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>For more information about the ODI and what it can do for you, email <a href=\"mailto:info@theodi.org\">info@theodi.org</a> or ask for Tom Tharakan at <a href=\"mailto:bizdev@theodi.org\">bizdev@theodi.org</a></strong></em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/the-value-of-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-value-of-open-data","slug":"the-value-of-open-data","title":"The value of open data","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-08-26T13:18:21+00:00","created_at":"2015-10-30T15:53:19+00:00","tag_ids":["page","open-data","economic","environmental","social","impact","evidence"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-enterprise-big-business-introduction.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/open-enterprise-big-business-introduction","slug":"open-enterprise-big-business-introduction","title":"Open enterprise: Introduction","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-04-01T11:08:45+00:00","created_at":"2016-03-08T08:59:56+00:00","tag_ids":["page","big-business","report","publications","thomson-reuters","arup","syngenta","open"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

You are Director of Government Innovation at <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/\">Nesta</a>. What does that involve?</strong></p>\n<p>I look after Nesta's work relating to government innovation. This means having responsibility for a range of cool projects, including the <a href=\"https://theodi.org/opendatachallengeseries\">Open Data Challenge Series</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>What first got you excited about open data?</strong></p>\n<p>This is going to sound very geeky, but in 2006 the Office of Fair Trading did a <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140402142426/http:/www.oft.gov.uk/news-and-updates/press/2006/171-06\">report on the Commercial Use of Public Information</a>. It was one of the first pieces of work I saw that set out the economic case for open data in detail (I think it may actually have predated the use of the phrase 'open data' in government).</p>\n<p><strong>When’s the last time you used open data?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://citymapper.com/\">Citymapper</a>, a transport app which I use on a near daily basis. I also suspect I use many other products on a day-to-day basis that are powered by open data without me realising.</p>\n<p><strong>What kind of open data would you like to see more of?</strong></p>\n<p>There's a strong case to be made for open data being used to make regulated markets work better. For example, if banks and energy companies kept a canonical list of live tariffs with standardised terms and conditions, it would allow for more sophisticated comparison services and remove all doubts about their objectivity.</p>\n<p><strong>What are you working on at the moment?</strong></p>\n<p>Quite a few things in addition to the <a href=\"https://theodi.org/opendatachallengeseries\">Open Data Challenge Series</a>. For instance, I'm looking after a project that helps city governments develop policies to support innovation and entrepreneurship. Another one focuses on helping local authorities to undertake digital transformation. I'm also <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/news/nesta-partners-behavioural-insights-team\">working with the Behavioural Insights Team</a> to develop a suite of products based around behavioural science.</p>\n<p><strong>What are you most looking forward to about the Open Data Awards?</strong></p>\n<p>Learning about all the different ways in which open data is being applied in practice.</p>\n<p><em>The <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/\">Open Data Awards</a> will be held on July 9 in partnership with Bloomberg at Bloomberg’s London offices on Finsbury Square.</em></p>\n<p><em>Explore all <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/nominations/\">nominees</a> and <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/2015-finalists/\">finalists</a> and follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ODIAwards\">#ODIAwards</a> for updates on the night.</em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"Open Data Awards","url":"http://awards.theodi.org/"}],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/estimating-your-market-potential-with-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/estimating-your-market-potential-with-open-data","slug":"estimating-your-market-potential-with-open-data","title":"Estimating your market potential with open data","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:55:12+00:00","created_at":"2014-01-14T13:17:43+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/announcing-the-2015-open-data-awards-finalists.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/announcing-the-2015-open-data-awards-finalists","slug":"announcing-the-2015-open-data-awards-finalists","title":"Announcing the 2015 Open Data Awards finalists","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:01:44+00:00","created_at":"2015-06-25T12:53:41+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","open-data-awards"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/for-me-smart-cities-are-about-openness.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/for-me-smart-cities-are-about-openness","slug":"for-me-smart-cities-are-about-openness","title":"'For me, smart cities are about openness' ","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:00:49+00:00","created_at":"2015-05-14T07:55:57+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","5-minutes-with","interview","odi-individual-supporter","smart-cities"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}}

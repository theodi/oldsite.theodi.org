While it’s true that the opportunities afforded by the opening of data troves to the public are almost infinite in kind, it’s often difficult to see how a mass of numbers can directly improve the average citizen’s life.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.socrata.com\">Socrata</a>, a group who \"appify\" data caches with the purpose of translating data into useable information, is a Seattle-based cloud software company and a newly signed member of the ODI. Socrata focus exclusively on democratising access to government data, helping public sector organisations to improve transparency, citizen service and fact-based decision-making by efficiently delivering data to citizens.</p>\n<p>We spoke to Socrata CEO Kevin Merritt about his involvement in the upcoming ODI Summit (29th October) and the possibility of an even more open definition of open data.  </p>\n<p><strong>What will you be talking about at the Summit?</strong></p>\n<p>I'll be sharing some of the most successful open data stories in U.S. cities, states and federal agencies.</p>\n<p><strong>Which innovation or discovery in open data has most surprised you?</strong></p>\n<p>How much professional satisfaction government employees experience when engaging with citizens, developers, entrepreneurs and researchers through data.</p>\n<p><strong>What direction do you see open data heading in over the next five years, and what most excites you about the future?</strong></p>\n<p>Data will flow seamlessly and multi-directionally through ecosystems and research networks, etc. The number, kind and variety of actors - publishers and consumers - in these data exchanges will significantly increase.</p>\n<p>As the number of councils, cities and countries opening up their data increases, which sector do you think stands to gain the most (business, government, commercial, environmental, etc.) and why?</p>\n<p>Government itself as a sector stands to gain the most because open data initiatives catalyze the transformation of data from raw resource to valuable asset and helping evolve government organizations from instinct-driven to data-driven. These two cultural changes will help governments operate more efficiently, serve their constituents more effectively and help them make better decisions about where to invest resources.</p>\n<p><em>Now less than a week away, the <a href=\"http://summit.theodi.org\">first annual Open Data Summit</a> will feature some of the biggest names working in the field(s). After a day of keynotes, fireside chats and lighting speeches, Sir Tim Berners-Lee will address an exclusive Gala Dinner. Tickets and a combination package for both the conference and the Gala Dinner are available now.</em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Matthew Sykes","slug":"matthew-sykes","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/matthew-sykes","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-summit-qa-dr-loren-treisman.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-summit-qa-dr-loren-treisman","slug":"odi-summit-qa-dr-loren-treisman","title":"ODI Summit: Q&A with Dr Loren Treisman","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:51:50+00:00","created_at":"2013-10-16T10:44:08+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-summit-qa-with-martin-tisne.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-summit-qa-with-martin-tisne","slug":"odi-summit-qa-with-martin-tisne","title":"ODI Summit: Q&A with Martin Tisne","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:52:36+00:00","created_at":"2013-10-24T15:06:49+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Matthew Sykes","slug":"matthew-sykes","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/matthew-sykes","tag_ids":[]}}

Whether it's all of the trips made on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/19982736#\">Barclays bikes over a 24 hour period</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.carbonculture.net/orgs/tate/#ccg_period=hourly&ccg_endtime=2013-07-22T00:00:00.000%2B0100\">energy usage at the Tate modern</a>, we want to know about it. We want to tell stories with this data, to visualise and bring it to life in the spaces we will be inhabiting during the Summit. We also want to hear your voice.</p>\n<p>So, if you happen to have a good source, know an interesting CSV file, or just have the beginning of an idea, then do let us know. You can get an idea of submissions made so far and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/theodi.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aorriq9nxtsldDJMQzQzVFBrUnlLYmd1R3RrZmtrZVE#gid=0\">make your own contribution here</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, then please <a href=\"mailto:phil.lang@theodi.org?subject=Question%3A%20ODI%20Summit%20Data%20Call\">get in touch</a>.</p>","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}}

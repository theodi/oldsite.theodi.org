Our activities to help achieve this range from supporting <a href=\"http://theodi.org/current-start-ups\">startups</a> to build products and services to bringing actors together in order to discuss the future of <a href=\"http://theodi.org/data-infrastructure\">data infrastructure</a>. </p>\n<p>By end of 2014 we realised we were frequently meeting similar types of individuals in our <a href=\"http://theodi.org/services\">services</a> work. These were people working within their governments to implement a vision, and a plan for how open data could benefit their country or city. Often they had the help of a small team, and possessed leadership qualities – such as drive, energy and strong communication skills – coupled with a creative approach to problem solving.</p>\n<p>Many of these public sector leaders came to us because they were facing similar challenges. Some found it tricky to encourage user engagement, others found themselves consistently making the case for open data, or had trouble sustaining momentum after the launch of an open data portal. Despite being from different geographical locations and holding different professional roles across national, state and city government levels, they faced similar roadblocks. Before long, we found through conversation with the leaders that often one would be having some success in solving a challenge that another was facing. </p>\n<p>With this in mind, the <a href=\"http://theodi.org/open-data-leaders-network\">Open Data Leaders’ Network</a> (ODLN) was born as a space for individuals leading the implementation of their government’s open data initiatives to connect, exchange ideas, and develop frameworks and strategies for solving problems. The ODLN also serves as a place for these individuals to reflect on their achievements as policy entrepreneurs driving organisational change in government. </p>\n<h3 id=\"impactsandbenefitsfromrefinedstrategiestowhatsappchats\">Impacts and benefits: from refined strategies to Whatsapp chats</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/news/national-leaders-create-global-network-open-data-impact\">Our first cohort ran in February 2015</a>, and now, one year on, we have convened a total of over 20 leaders from across five continents, including New Zealand, the UK, the Philippines, Macedonia, and Buenos Aires, Argentina. <a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/how-a-clash-of-unfiltered-ideas-helped-open-data-leaders-plan-their-initiatives\">A wealth of knowledge and experience has been exchanged and problems consolidated in this year.</a> In the sessions held in London, leaders worked on new strategies to connect the supply and demand sides of open data, promoting innovation and organising training in their own departments. </p>\n<p>Additionally, via ongoing communication in a Whatsapp group, leaders exchange tips for creating new departmental action plans and organised further meetups at open data and open government conferences around the world. </p>\n<p>In December 2015, <a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/open-data-leaders-open-call/\">we launched an open call</a> inviting leaders from around the world to become part of the network, and received over 40 applications.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"meetthe2016opendataleaders\">Meet the 2016 open data leaders</h3>\n<p>This week, we have welcomed our third cohort of nine open data leaders from four continents to London. <a href=\"http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures/friday-lunchtime-lecture-innovating-in-government-from-the-inside-meet-the-open-data-leaders\">Sign up here to attend our lunchtime lecture on Friday 26 February to learn more about their projects</a>. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/cf/0d/56cf0db11f986a085800000d/ODLN2016.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img text-center\" id=\"56cf0db1d0d46206b0000034\">\n<small>The open data leaders sharing what they work on.

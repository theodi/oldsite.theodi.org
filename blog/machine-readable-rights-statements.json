This includes making the process of opening up data clear and simple for any organisation.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/news/new-certificates-launched-help-everyone-discover-understand-and-use-open-data\">recent launch</a>\u0002of the <a href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/\">Open Data Certicates</a>\u0002sees the ODI begin to \u0002provide tools that support best practices in this area. The certificates provide guidance to publishers, helping them to identify a variety of issues to be considered when releasing data, whilst also giving re-users some assurance as to the quality of open datasets.</p>\n<p>Data published to the web should always be accompanied by machine-readable metadata describing all aspects of the dataset including is content, origin, publication schedule and, importantly, clear licensing. A clear statement of re-use rights can ensure that consumers fully understand both how a dataset can be re-used and any obligations that they may incur through that usage.</p>\n<p>Through the Open Data Certificates, the ODI will be encouraging data publishers to publish machine-readable metadata. In fact doing so is key criteria for reaching each level of certification.</p>\n<p>There are several existing efforts to help standardise dataset metadata, including the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#class-dataset\">W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary</a>\u0002(DCAT). Publishers should use these standards to help describe their data.</p>\n<p>However in a few cases there are gaps in existing standards that merits further work. This is particularly true in the case of publishing machine-readable rights information.</p>\n<p>At the ODI we are currently working on a new vocabulary to support the publication of \"Open Data Rights Statements\". The vocabulary <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/open-data-licensing/wiki/Related-Work\">builds upon and extends</a>\u0002the Dublin Core and Creative Commons vocabularies to support the description of Rights Statements that may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A reference to a license for the dataset</li>\n<li>A reference to a content license that applies to copyrightable parts of a dataset -- an important piece of metadata in juristications that recognise database rights</li>\n<li>Copyright notices</li>\n<li>Attribution metadata to support re-users in acknowledging their sources</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alongside the vocabulary we have drafted guides for both <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/open-data-licensing/blob/master/guides/publisher-guide.md\">publishers</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/open-data-licensing/blob/master/guides/reusers-guide.md\">re-users</a>\u0002that will describe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to publish machine-readable rights statements as RDFa, Linked Data, or as additions to existing JSON or XML formats</li>\n<li>How to link to rights statements from both web pages and APIs</li>\n<li>Guidance for developers on how to apply this metadata to build attribution and citation links</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The guides are still a work in progress but can be viewed in <a href=\"http://github.com/theodi/open-data-licensing\">our github repository</a>. We would love\u0002to hear your feedback on any aspect of the work.\u0002Please <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/open-data-licensing/issues\">submit issues and\u0002comments on github</a>.</p>\n<p>Once complete these guides will form part of a broader set of guidance from the ODI on how to publish standards-compliant dataset metadata.</p>","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Leigh Dodds","slug":"leigh-dodds","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/leigh-dodds","tag_ids":["team","rnd-programme","staff"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Leigh Dodds","slug":"leigh-dodds","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/leigh-dodds","tag_ids":["team","rnd-programme","staff"]}}

The existing complaints process administered by OPSI is complex and OPSI's decisions are non-binding. Under the government's proposal, a re-user could have to apply to a First Tier Tribunal after going through the OPSI process simply to have OPSI's decision enforced, adding delays and potentially discouraging re-use.</p>\n<p>ICO already rules on complaints under the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000, among other areas of legislation, and this would align the regime for re-use with the regime for access – particularly relevant since the “right to data” was introduced in the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012. </p>\n<p>We have clarified, though, as rightly pointed out by <a href=\"http://mapgubbins.tumblr.com/post/99018785840/uk-government-consultation-on-transposition-of-the-new\" title=\"Owen Boswarva\">Owen Boswarva</a>, that there should be an appeals mechanism from ICO, and recourse to a First Tier Tribunal is appropriate. This is in line with existing ICO appeals mechanisms. Our main concern is ensuring re-users (and public bodies) don't experience undue delays and costs going through the complaints process. </p>\n<h3 id=\"whathappensnext\">What happens next?</h3>\n<p>As this stage, it doesn’t look like there will be another public opportunity to comment on the UK’s proposals. Taking into account how much is still unclear from the initial consultation, the ODI in its submission urges the government to publish its proposed amendments to the 2005 Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations for further consultation.</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Ellen Broad","slug":"ellen-broad","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/ellen-broad","tag_ids":["team","team","team","team","services-programme","policy"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/our-draft-submission-to-the-uk-consultation-on-reuse-of-public-sector-information.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/our-draft-submission-to-the-uk-consultation-on-reuse-of-public-sector-information","slug":"our-draft-submission-to-the-uk-consultation-on-reuse-of-public-sector-information","title":"UK proposes changes to re-use of public information: ODI fears a backwards step","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:57:08+00:00","created_at":"2014-09-25T15:24:54+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Ellen Broad","slug":"ellen-broad","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/ellen-broad","tag_ids":["team","team","team","team","services-programme","policy"]}}

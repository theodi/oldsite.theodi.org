It is an approach that helps build resilient and sustainable public services where payments are made based on specified outcomes that can be proven to have taken place according to a set of measurable indicators. These indicators are verified and validated on a monthly or quarterly basis by external verifiers and local communities who provide independent feedback through interviews and mobile devices. <a href=\"https://www.cordaid.org/en/\">Cordaid</a> pioneered RBF for health in Sub-Saharan Africa and is at present involved in RBF programs in 13 countries in healthcare and education.</p>\n<p>In response to the growing call from the open development movement, to provide access and accurate up-to-date data on projects, Cordaid is making its RBF data available through OpenRBF platforms. <a href=\"http://www.openrbf.org/\">OpenRBF</a> is a web based Open Source software that manages result and performance and makes this data accessible to all stakeholders. </p>\n<p>OpenRBF encourages citizens to engage with vital development issues and hold their governments and development stakeholders accountable when delivering key services. The transparency offered by OpenRBF helps to restore trust between citizens, local and national governments and private sector service providers.</p>\n<p><strong>OpenRBF in action: a case study from Burundi</strong></p>\n<p>In Burundi, Cordaid uses OpenRBF in both the healthcare and education sectors. For the RBF programme in education, we are about to launch the OpenRBF portal and have begun collecting data with tablets using the Open Data Kit instead of traditional paper based reporting. This allows for automatic transfer of data collected to the OpenRBF platform. The advantage of using tablets can be seen in terms of efficiency (time saved by the verifiers who no longer have to manually input data, calculate payments and prepare invoices) and cost saving (per quarter up to two weeks of reduced labour costs).</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/ae/48/55ae4801f362be5d3b000017/AB0CF103-3AFB-4484-A944-1859D4A7FF06A3EDB227-5EAE-4342-971F-916E03AFB28E.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"55ae48011f986a5d9d000025\"> </p>\n<p>The data collected is then processed and visualized on the OpenRBF platform and made accessible for all stakeholders. The back-end of OpenRBF is where the data is processed into payments, allows for the production of forms, reports, dashboards and data extractions. The front end visualizes the data and makes the data available to download as an open dataset. </p>\n<p>This dynamic data driven approach has improved the efficiency and effectiveness of our Results Based Financing approach and helps further strengthen healthcare and education systems in the countries it works.</p>\n<p><strong>Call to action</strong></p>\n<p>In the midst of a data revolution and a new set of <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/topics/sustainabledevelopmentgoals\">Sustainable Development Goals</a>, the utilization of innovative data tools, such as OpenRBF, will lead to more accountable and results-oriented programmes. Through the use of open data driven products, Cordaid aims to increase transparency, improve systems and ensure that each stakeholder has access to the information.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Burundi OpenRBF platform will be launched later this month.

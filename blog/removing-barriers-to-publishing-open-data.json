Despite the fact that GitHub has done some great work towards lowering the barriers to adoption, such as its <a href=\"https://windows.github.com/\">desktop</a> <a href=\"https://mac.github.com/\">clients</a>, the fact still remains that GitHub is a technical tool, and, as such, the barriers remain there to those who don't code.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, I decided to use my recent innovation week to build a web-based front-end for publishing data on GitHub.</p>\n<p>Using our <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/data-publishing-template\">best practice guidance to publishing data on GitHub</a> as inspiration, I put together <a href=\"http://git-data-publisher.herokuapp.com/\">Git Data Publisher</a> (the name needs some work). Currently it allows users to sign in using their GitHub account, add some information about their dataset, and add any number of data files.</p>\n<p>Once a user has filled out and submitted the form, this generates a new GitHub repo that not only contains their data files, but also has an automatically generated <a href=\"http://dataprotocols.org/data-packages/\">datapackage.json</a> file, containing metadata about the dataset, such as the licence and publication frequency, amongst other things. </p>\n<p>It also generates an HTML representation of the dataset (with <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/\">DCAT metadata</a> embedded inside), which is accessed via GitHub pages (another wonderful service that GitHub provide which allows free publication of static HTML websites). </p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"http://github.com/git-data-publisher/Transactions-over-25-000-in-the-Foreign-and-Commonwealth-Office\">see an example here</a>, and <a href=\"http://git-data-publisher.github.io/Transactions-over-25-000-in-the-Foreign-and-Commonwealth-Office\">an example of the generated webpage</a>.</p>\n<p>The way this works fits in perfectly with the many-parts-loosely-joined approach that we take to developing tools at the ODI, and one of the things I'd like to add to this is the ability to automatically generate an Open Data Certificate for the dataset using the <a href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org\">Open Data Certificates</a> API, as well as auto-validation of CSV files using <a href=\"http://csvlint.io\">CSVlint</a>. </p>\n<p>The tool is by no means finished, and some of the features I'd like to add in future innovation weeks include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>editing a dataset's metadata using the web interface</li>\n<li>updating data files and adding new ones</li>\n<li>publicly accessible views of all datasets uploaded using the tool (together with data)</li>\n<li>adding (and validating against) a schema</li>\n<li>letting users change the look and feel of the generated webpages</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can see more details of the features (and add new ones if you're so minded) on the <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/git-data-publisher/issues\">project's issues tracker in GitHub</a>, and please feel free to <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/git-data-publisher\">fork the repo</a> and add your own features if you fancy helping out with the project!</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{}}

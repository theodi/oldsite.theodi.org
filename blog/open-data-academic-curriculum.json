How are you doing?</strong></p>\n<p>We’re busy looking for cities, causes and brands interested in making good use of open data.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you, or your organisation, do in a nutshell?</strong></p>\n<p>Our mission is to inform policies and improve communities by educating, empowering, and engaging those around us to use open data.</p>\n<p><strong>What first got you excited about open data?</strong></p>\n<p>We heard many talking about the potential of open data – to engage residents, share data across silos, and to make data-driven decisions – and felt a call to act, to create strategies that help cities, causes, and brands accomplish these goals.</p>\n<p><strong>What are your biggest data challenges?</strong></p>\n<p>Agencies with open data portals have accomplished their first goal: to increase transparency. We’re inspired to help our clients accomplish their next biggest open data challenges by creating an ecosystem of sharing internally, raising the visibility of data externally, and supporting the creation of innovative, new applications.</p>\n<p><strong>What kind of open data would you like to see more of?</strong></p>\n<p>We want to see more data visualisations, analysis, and web applications that make good use of existing open data. To this end, we’re partnering with educational institutions to insert open data into the academic curriculum, providing training for both civic technologists and agency administrators publishing open data.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you feel about being nominated for an open data award?</strong></p>\n<p>We’re beyond thrilled to be nominated. We deserve to win because unlike our competitors, we’re a social benefit corporation intended to do good and do well.</p>\n<p><em>The <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/\">Open Data Awards</a> will be held on July 9 in partnership with Bloomberg at Bloomberg’s London offices on Finsbury Square.</em></p>\n<p><em>Explore all <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/nominations/\">nominees</a> and <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/2015-finalists/\">finalists</a> and follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ODIAwards\">#ODIAwards</a> for updates on the night.</em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"Open Data Awards","url":"http://awards.theodi.org/"}],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/gla-open-data-helps-break-down-artificial-administrative-boundaries-in-cities.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/gla-open-data-helps-break-down-artificial-administrative-boundaries-in-cities","slug":"gla-open-data-helps-break-down-artificial-administrative-boundaries-in-cities","title":"GLA: ‘Open data helps break down artificial administrative boundaries in cities’","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:02:09+00:00","created_at":"2015-07-08T22:22:15+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","open-data","gla"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/open-data-job-creation-transparency-culture-shift-kenya.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/open-data-job-creation-transparency-culture-shift-kenya","slug":"open-data-job-creation-transparency-culture-shift-kenya","title":"Open data means job creation, transparency and a culture shift in Kenya ","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:02:10+00:00","created_at":"2015-07-08T22:30:33+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","kenya","open-data-awards","transparency"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/positive-social-economic-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/positive-social-economic-open-data","slug":"positive-social-economic-open-data","title":"OCSI: 'Positive social and economic data is out there, we just don’t talk about it enough’","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:02:26+00:00","created_at":"2015-07-09T11:36:30+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","open-data-awards","economic","social","open-data"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/announcing-the-2015-open-data-awards-finalists.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/announcing-the-2015-open-data-awards-finalists","slug":"announcing-the-2015-open-data-awards-finalists","title":"Announcing the 2015 Open Data Awards finalists","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:01:44+00:00","created_at":"2015-06-25T12:53:41+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","open-data-awards"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}}

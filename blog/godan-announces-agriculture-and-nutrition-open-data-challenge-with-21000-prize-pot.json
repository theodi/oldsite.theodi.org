GODAN partner organisations include government, international and private sector organisations, who focus on making data relevant to agriculture and nutrition more available, accessible and usable. </p>\n<h3 id=\"whatkindsofopendatainnovationsexistalreadyinagricultureandnutrition\">What kinds of open data innovations exist already in agriculture and nutrition?</h3>\n<p>Successful innovations usually start by focusing on a specific problem, before finding relevant data that can help inform products or services that would help to solve it. Some great initiatives in this area are already gaining pace, which could serve as inspiration for those keen to work on their own solution.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.groenmonitor.nl/\">GroenMonitor</a></strong> offers a vegetation map of the Netherlands, which has been derived from satellite mapping. This makes pest outbreaks easier to identify and mitigate.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.awhere.com/\">AWhere</a></strong> combines weather observations, forecast models and historical records, and downscales them to field level to help farmers and policymakers forecast and plan.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.godan.info/news/agrihack-open-data-prize-winners-mobielectro\">MobiElectro</a></strong> draws on open data from FAO Land and Water, CCAFS to provide a water monitoring system that tells the farmer when to water crops.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.plantwise.org/\">Plantwise</a></strong> helps smallholder farmers in developing countries deal with plant health issues. It aims to increase food security and improve rural livelihoods by reducing crop losses from pests and diseases.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>More diverse examples of data innovation in agriculture and nutrition from around the world were featured in a <a href=\"https://theodi.org/how-improve-agriculture-food-nutrition-open-data\">report</a> that the ODI produced in partnership with GODAN in 2015.</p>\n<h3 id=\"andwhataboutpolicyinnovations\">And what about policy innovations?</h3>\n<p>It can be difficult to identify specific open data innovations in policy as they are often designed and agreed behind closed doors. However, there are certain challenges that GODAN partner organisations highlighted in interviews with the GODAN team earlier this year, which can help inform policymaking.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Open data is misunderstood and poorly used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Datasets are not clearly licensed </p></li>\n<li><p>Consumers of the data don’t necessarily abide by the license conditions when they are licensed</p></li>\n<li><p>Data is not provided in a format that is appropriate for developers to use</p></li></ul></li>\n<li><p>Cultural challenges exist – farmers don’t want to share the secrets of their success with others because they operate in competition with one another. </p></li>\n<li><p>There is a lack of awareness and understanding of how open data can be beneficial to both publisher and reuser (entrepreneur)</p></li>\n<li><p>There is a lack of capacity and capability to prepare, publish and maintain the data within many third and public sector organisations.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How to submit an entry to the GODAN Open Data Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>The GODAN Open Data Challenge is powered by <a href=\"http://www.tffchallenge.com/\">Thought for Food</a> and Presidents United to Solve Hunger (<a href=\"http://www.pushtosign.org/\">PUSH</a>).

We still have our final challenge on Jobs within which we are currently supporting our three finalists to develop their idea in advance of the overall winner being announced at the <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/\">Open Data Awards</a> in July.. Over the next couple of months all of our winners, and indeed some of our finalists, will be further refining, and in many cases fully launching, their products.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/64/75/556475b4f362be0958000046/nesta-odcs-handbook-web-med-6_0.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"556475b41f986a0869000123\"> </p>\n<p>The ODCS is a process to coordinate this activity to ensure the best chance of developing a strong, sustainable open data product. In designing the ODCS we’ve learnt from lots of others - hack days and hackathons, other startup incubators and accelerators - but we’ve put them together in way which maximises the likelihood of creating sustainable ongoing products. With everything we’ve learnt so far about supporting teams of people to use open data for social good we think we’re in a great position to build on this in our future work. </p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>This item was <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/open-data-challenge-series-handbook-our-story-so-far\">originally posted by ODCS partner Nesta</a>.</em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"Download the handbook","url":"http://www.nesta.org.uk/sites/default/files/nesta-odi-odcs-handbook.pdf"}],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/opendatachallengeseries.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/opendatachallengeseries","slug":"opendatachallengeseries","title":"Open Data Challenge Series","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-11-09T12:15:14+00:00","created_at":"2012-12-13T09:45:46+00:00","tag_ids":["page","event:open-data-challenge-series","challenge-series","open-data"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

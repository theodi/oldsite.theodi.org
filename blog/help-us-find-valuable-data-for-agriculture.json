Through this research we came across a number of different types, sources and examples of data related to the sector.</p>\n<p>We have published this list as <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19kqNFLhMTY396N-n5dgiUXJic8dkpRMesk0xj_fin44/edit#gid=1904324530\">a Google Sheet</a>, and invite you to contribute to it.

Your contributions will ultimately help us all to develop a <strong>better understanding of data in the sector</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>As well as contributing to the spreadsheet, if you have experiences or ideas to share about improving agriculture and nutrition with open data, we want to hear from you.

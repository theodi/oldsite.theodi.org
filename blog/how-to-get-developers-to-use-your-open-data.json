A consortium led by the <a href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/courses/depts/employmentres/\">Institute for Employment Research at the University of Warwick</a> worked in partnership with <a href=\"http://www.pontydysgu.org/\">Pontydysgu</a>, <a href=\"http://www.raycommedia.com/\">Raycom</a> and <a href=\"http://rewiredstate.org/\">Rewired State</a> to create this open data set, now certified by the ODI.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/96/15/5296150fd0d4622bf500008b/image_0.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img pull-right\" id=\"5296150ff362be7d2500004d\"> We've recently launched an <a href=\"http://www.appchallenge.net\">App Challenge</a> to encourage developers to use employment data and statistics. Supported by Google, Ubuntu, HP and the Open Data Institute we're interested to see if we can increase the use of the open data and create some innovative apps that make a real difference to society. We're also investing in the next generation of digital pioneers with a <a href=\"http://careerhack.appchallenge.net/download-brief/\">special prize</a> for 16-24 year olds studying within the UK. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lmiforall.org.uk/\">LMI for All</a> contains robust LMI from national surveys/sources providing a common and consistent baseline to use alongside less formal sources of intelligence. The data portal makes data freely available and encourages open use by applications and websites that can bring the data to life for varying audiences. At heart this is an open data project, which will support the wider government agenda to encourage use and re-use of government data sets.</p>\n<p>The data tool includes LMI that can answer the questions people commonly ask when thinking about their careers, including ‘what do people get paid?’ and 'what type of person does that job?' It will include data about characteristics of people who work in different occupations, what level of qualifications they have, how much they get paid, and allow people to make comparisons across different jobs and regions. </p>\n<p>Using the data throws up some fascinating statistics. Did you know that the UK will need 300,000 more digital professionals by 2020? And that, in the same period, we'll need 9.85% more nurses too? Hopefully the latter isn't caused by the increase in digital professionals!\n<img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/96/0e/52960eaef362be664f000074/image_2.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img text-center\" id=\"52960eae1f986a6a1b00004a\">\nIf you’d like to enter the contest, it closes on Friday February 21st at 5pm.

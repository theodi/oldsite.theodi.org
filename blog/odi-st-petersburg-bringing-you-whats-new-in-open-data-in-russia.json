Similarly, our <a href=\"http://www.foodpedia.tk/\">Foodpedia</a> programme is designed to expose the open data on food products to consumers to assist them in making informed purchase decisions. The project offers a mobile app for in-store use-case scenarios. </p>\n<p>We are also working to enrich cultural experience with a <a href=\"http://www.culturecloud.ru/\">Russian Linked Culture Cloud</a>. A fully interactive Web portal for Russian cultural heritage data, it integrates data for heritage institutions (museums, galleries, etc) to create a common 'infospace' experience for site visitors. </p>\n<h3 id=\"howwebecameanodistorynode\">How we became an ODI Story Node</h3>\n<p>We found out about the ODI and its <a href=\"http://theodi.org/nodes\">network of nodes</a> in September 2013 thanks to our team member Irina Radchenko, who at that time was taking an <a href=\"http://theodi.org/courses/open-data-in-practice-3days\">Open Data in Practice</a> course at ODI. There she learnt about ODI Nodes and quite soon she initiated the establishment of ODI Moscow supported by the NGO “<a href=\"http://www.infoculture.ru/\">Information Culture</a>”. In time the node migrated to St Petersburg, to be hosted by ITMO University.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of March we put the wheels in motion to become <a href=\"http://stpetersburg.theodi.org/\">ODI St Petersburg</a>, and join the <a href=\"http://theodi.org/our-network\">ODI's global network</a> as a Story Node. </p>\n<p>As a Story Node, we will focus on spreading the word about open data success stories and encouraging others to adopt open data principles. </p>\n<p>From now on, we will be posting news and reviews about practical open data tools and solutions, and what is going on in the open data world. </p>\n<h3 id=\"whatsnewforopendatainrussia\">What’s new for open data in Russia?</h3>\n<p>So far, 2016 has been a lively year for open data in Russia.</p>\n<p>In January, <a href=\"http://www.infoculture.ru/\">Information Culture</a>, an NGO that promotes open data, released a <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.47500\">report</a> on the state of open data in Russia in 2015. The report assesses the openness of government resources and provides the list of key datasets, such as Companies, Crime and justice, Transport and infrastructure, and much more. Beyond that it contains brief profiles of current open data projects, and explains the activities of the <a href=\"http://opendata.open.gov.ru/\">Russian Open Data Council</a>.</p>\n<p>Other examples of government open data projects featured in the report include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The <a href=\"http://data.gov.ru/\">Open Data portal of Russian Federation</a> </p></li>\n<li><p>The <a href=\"http://fedstat.ru\">Unified Interdepartmental Statistical Information System EMISS</a></p></li>\n<li><p>The <a href=\"https://proverki.gov.ru\">Federal Public Information System Uniform Checks Registry</a> </p></li>\n<li><p>The <a href=\"http://regulation.gov.ru/\">Federal Portal of Regulatory Documents</a> </p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://torgi.gov.ru\">The official website of the Russian Federation to publish tender information</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The report concludes that despite many important successes, the openness and accessibility of Russian government data requires systemic reform. It urges for proper legislation to govern the rights and restrictions on access to information. </p>\n<p>At the beginning of March, many Russian open data groups headed to Montevideo in Uruguay, where the 9th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance (ICEGOV) was held. The Russian participants presented several <a href=\"http://www.icegov.org/publications/accepted-papers-2/\">papers</a> on open budgets, and updated the audience on two open budget projects. One was on the development of the <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/k0shk/open-budget-format-issues-on-development-of-specification-and-converter-implementation\">open budget format</a>, and the other on the methodology for evaluating and rating open municipal budgets in Russia.</p>\n<p>Also in March, many in Russia <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/okfnru/events/156390472/\">celebrated</a> International Open Data Day. The most notable event was a seminar held by Impact Hub Moscow. It lured over 60 open data enthusiasts from all over the country, and included a hackathon, unconference and session on open science.

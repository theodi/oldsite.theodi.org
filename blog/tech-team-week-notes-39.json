During the quieter periods, <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/tom-heath\">Tom</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/ulrich-atz\">Ulrich</a> mastered the finer points of\u0002croquet, while the rest of us practised our Gin &amp; Tonic technique.\u0002Having then laid out our plans for our next three months, we then returned to London to catch up on all the work we missed while we were away.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/jeni-tennison\">Jeni</a> started with\u0002a coordination chat with the OKFN, followed by doing a webinar on data standards for <a href=\"http://www.opendataresearch.org/\">ODDC</a> on Thursday. Friday brought a keynote at the \"Managing Research Data with Linked Data\"\u0002seminar\u0002organised by <a href=\"http://data.ac.uk\">data.ac.uk</a>. Meanwhile,\u0002<a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/tom-heath\">Tom</a> ploughed through his backlog after getting back from India, and then got <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/maximilian-heimst%C3%A4dt/27/634/662\">Max</a>, one of our new research interns, settled in. Max, in turn, started the data collection for his\u0002MSc dissertation project. To get a picture of the UK Open Data ecosystem, he conducted interviews with various people inside and outside the ODI, and participated in events like the OKFN meet-up and the Science and Technology Foundation roundtable discussion.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/stuart-harrison\">Stuart</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/ulrich-atz\">Ulrich</a>\u0002spent the week working on a secret project, which Stuart has codenamed \"Qiameth\" for reasons known only to him and the random word generator he used. It's unusual for us to not be working in a 100% open way, but this is a temporary situation; the result will be fully open once it's ready for release! It's looking good; you'll like it.\u0002<a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/sam-pikesley\">Sam</a> spent some time improving our Chef robots to handle multiple deployment branches, and also diving headlong into data munging in Ruby, for the same secret project.</p>\n<p>When not wearing a penguin mask (pictured above), <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/james-smith\">I</a> spent a while improving our build system, and have replaced a whole load of hairy Jenkins configuration with a <a href=\"http://github.com/theodi/master-builder\">pretty short DSL script</a>, which\u0002I'll cover in more detail in a future blog post.</p>","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"James Smith","slug":"james-smith","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/james-smith","tag_ids":["team","rnd-programme","research-and-development","odi-labs"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"James Smith","slug":"james-smith","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/james-smith","tag_ids":["team","rnd-programme","research-and-development","odi-labs"]}}

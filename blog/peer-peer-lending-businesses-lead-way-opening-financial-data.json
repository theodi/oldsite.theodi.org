Using data from the three biggest P2P platforms in the UK (<a href=\"http://uk.zopa.com/\">Zopa</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ratesetter.com/\">RateSetter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fundingcircle.com/\">Funding Circle</a>) we highlight the regional geography of lending in the UK.

All four - London, South East, South West and the East of England - are in the South of the UK.</li>\n<li>The range of lending per person ranges from £1.40 to £11.80 between UK regions, whereas the range for recipients only varies between £3.90 and £7.30 per person.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some quick stats from the report:</p>\n<table class=\"table\"><tbody><tr><td>Time period</td><td>From October 2010 to May 2013</td></tr><tr><td>Number of lenders</td><td>48,891</td></tr><tr><td>Number of recipients</td><td>59,851</td></tr><tr><td>Number of loan parts</td><td>~ 14 million*</td></tr><tr><td>Total amount</td><td>£378 million</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>\u0002</p>\n<p>The unit of analysis is a loan part. A recipient who takes out a loan of, for example,\u0002£5,000 may receive the money from hundreds of different lenders. Vice versa, a lender may subdivide her investment into many loans. A typical (<a href=\"http://smtm.labs.theodi.org/methodology#median\">median</a>) amount for a loan part is £10. However, in a small number of cases the investment per loan part is substantially larger.</p>\n<p><strong>An interactive visualisation with the consumer in mind</strong></p>\n<p>One reason for opening up this data is to build consumers' trust by being transparent. We also wanted to give individuals a way of exploring this vast data set. The visualisation allows you to drill into a specific region of the UK and compare it to the rest of the country. As the data derives from individuals, it is of course personal data. However, we went to great length, including carrying out a <a href=\"http://smtm.labs.theodi.org/privacy/\">small-scale\u0002privacy impact assessment</a>,\u0002to protect people's privacy.\u0002\n<a href=\"http://smtm.labs.theodi.org\"><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/legacy/recipients.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Growth in the market is expected to continue</strong></p>\n<p>P2P lending has been growing rapidly over the last few years.

We demonstrate here how to publish open data and how to make it accessible. In sum this project is a step toward a more publicly transparent and comprehensive mapping of the financial system. Eventually we hope this map will become updated in real-time with data feeds directly sourced from P2P platforms and other financial markets.</p>\n<p>Go on and have a play -\u0002<a href=\"http://smtm.labs.theodi.org\">show yourself the money!</a></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{}}

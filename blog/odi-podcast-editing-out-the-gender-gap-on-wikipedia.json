In the 15 years since its launch, Wikipedia has come to offer more than <a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Our_projects\">24 million articles</a> written in 247 languages.</p>\n<p>As you might expect, the gender split amongst Wikipedia users is roughly equal. And given that virtually anyone with access to the internet is free to contribute to the knowledge platform with neutral, cited information, you'd assume the same would be true of the gender split amongst contributors. </p>\n<p>However, there are significantly fewer women who contribute to and volunteer as editors for Wikipedia than men. This issue of women’s underrepresentation – in both back-end editorial processes and a front-end bias of information – is increasingly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_bias_on_Wikipedia\">well-documented</a>.</p>\n<p>In this podcast, Lucy Crompton-Reid reflects on the issue and outlines the work being done by her charity, <a href=\"https://wikimedia.org.uk/wiki/Main_Page\">Wikimedia UK</a>, to address it as part of a broader drive to support Wikipedia contributors and improve the quality of its content.</p>\n<p>Lucy also talks about her experience engaging people to develop and build on open knowledge platforms more generally, and offers her advice for women and men who strive to improve women's rights standards and opportunities in their careers.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/263764749&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em><strong>This podcast was presented by <a href=\"https://theodi.org/team/anna-scott\">Anna Scott</a> and produced by Freya Hellier.

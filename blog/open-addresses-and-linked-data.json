As someone who has campaigned tirelessly for open postcodes, and, in my previous role at a local authority, who is only too aware of the issues surrounding licensing of geodata, this is something I'm passionate about too.</p>\n<p>However, all the talk recently has been around making the Postcode Address File (PAF) public, which, given that the Royal Mail is about to be privatised, I can understand.</p>\n<p>That said, after a <a href=\"https://secure.mysociety.org/admin/lists/pipermail/developers-public/2013-February/008339.html\">discussion on the My Society mailing list</a>, I've heard directly from the people who have used the PAF and their experiences haven't been good. The data quality is inconsistent and it's not maintained very well. I suspect. If this data is opened up, there may not be an argument for a privatised Royal Mail to continue maintaining it.</p>\n<p>There is, however, a third way. The UK already has a super-accurate, up-to-date and well maintained database of address data. It's managed by local authorities as part of their day-to-day activities, and regularly updated.</p>\n<p>That database is the <a href=\"http://www.nlpg.org.uk/nlpg/welcome.htm\">National Land and Property Gazeteer</a> (NLPG). It is managed centrally by GeoPlace, a public sector partnership between the Local Government Association and Ordnance Survey. When local authorities collect data about a new property, they enter it into their databases in an agreed standard. This local data is then submitted to GeoPlace and entered into the national gazeteer.</p>\n<p>Crucially, every property in this database is given a unique idenfier, known as a Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN), which, if this data were opened up, gives us great scope for linking datasets together and giving every single property its own URI.</p>\n<p>This would have the benefit that when two datasets are talking about (for example) 123 High Street, Anytown, we're definitely talking about the same property.</p>\n<p>If we could open up this data, not only would we have a reliable, well-maintained source of address data, we would also have a key piece in the jigsaw of getting truly linked geographical data.</p>","organizations":[],"author":{}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{}}

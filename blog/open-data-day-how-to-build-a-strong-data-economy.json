We need a strong data economy to underpin this movement. </p>\n<p>However, like all emerging markets, the data economy has a way to go in building the strength it needs to make a significant positive impact. Identifiable gaps in the data economy – including a strong data infrastructure, investment in data skills and data innovation – must all be addressed for its potential to be reached sustainably.</p>\n<p>In this video – recorded for our node <a href=\"https://twitter.com/odivienna\">ODI Vienna</a>'s <a href=\"http://opendataday.org/\">Open Data Day</a> event – our CEO <a href=\"https://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison\">Jeni Tennison</a> takes us through a 'how to', addressing these gaps in detail. But beyond these immediate gaps, Jeni says, is the need for governments and the private sector to consider the roles of equity, ethics and engagement in the push for a stronger data economy. </p>\n<p>Jeni concludes with the idea that through advocating an open approach in considering these aspects, we maximise the positive impact of the data economy for everyone.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you have ideas or experience in open data that you'd like to share, <a href=\"mailto:production@theodi.org\" title=\"pitch us a blog\">pitch us a blog</a> or tweet us at [@ODIHQ](https://twitter.com/odihq “@ODIHQ”).</strong></em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","team","strategy-programme","staff","ceo"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-podcast-open-data-stories-from-argentina-and-kenya.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-podcast-open-data-stories-from-argentina-and-kenya","slug":"odi-podcast-open-data-stories-from-argentina-and-kenya","title":"ODI Podcast: Open data stories from Argentina and Kenya","format":"article","updated_at":"2017-03-03T14:33:57+00:00","created_at":"2017-03-02T14:13:21+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","odi-podcast","open-data-day","sdgs","women-in-data"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/we-need-to-strengthen-our-data-infrastructure.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/we-need-to-strengthen-our-data-infrastructure","slug":"we-need-to-strengthen-our-data-infrastructure","title":"We need to strengthen our data infrastructure","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-01-11T09:50:28+00:00","created_at":"2016-01-08T12:35:12+00:00","tag_ids":["page","data-infrastructure"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/raconteur-report-who-owns-our-data-infrastructure.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/raconteur-report-who-owns-our-data-infrastructure","slug":"raconteur-report-who-owns-our-data-infrastructure","title":"In the data economy who owns our data infrastructure?","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:01:46+00:00","created_at":"2015-06-23T12:56:24+00:00","tag_ids":["news","national-data-infrastructure","global-data-infrastructure","governance","strategy","government","business","society"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","team","strategy-programme","staff","ceo"]}}

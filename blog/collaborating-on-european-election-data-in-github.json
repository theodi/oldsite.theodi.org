We know it's great for collaborating on code (millions of people and thousands of teams use it every day), but can it be used for data too?</p>\n<p>When we collaborate on code, we use the <a href=\"http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html\">Github flow model</a>, that is we work on some code, write tests, then open a pull request to merge the code into the main codebase. We use <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org\">Travis</a> to run our tests, and, if the tests pass, the code gets merged.</p>\n<p>This works really well for us, but translating this to data is a different matter. Generally when you collaborate on data, we don't have an automated way of checking the data is in the correct format before any pull requests are merged.</p>\n<p>This got me thinking, after our work on <a href=\"http://csvlint.io/\">CSVlint</a>, we now have a way of not only checking the formatting of data, but also checking if it matches a schema. Could we use the code we've already written to use <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org\">Travis</a> to test the data and use a similar flow to our code?</p>\n<p>I decided to use my innovation time to find out - the result is <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/cid\">Cid</a>, a Ruby script which validates data in a Github repo, and can generate a new <a href=\"http://dataprotocols.org/data-packages/\">Datapackage</a> and push this to Github automatically if the validation is sucessful. If you're interested in the nuts and bolts of it, you can <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/cid/blob/master/README.md\">read the README</a>, but I'd like to use this blog post to ask for your help to test it out.</p>\n<p>As we know, at the time of writing, voting in the UK European Elections took place yesterday. The count won't take place until Sunday night, so I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to try out Cid, and see what collaborating on data in real time looks like.</p>\n<p>I've set up a <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/euro-elections\">repo in Github</a> which will contain the data. There's detailed instructions on how to submit your data <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/euro-elections/blob/gh-pages/README.md\">in the Readme</a> (it assumes at least some knowledge of Github, but you don't need to be a developer to submit some data). </p>\n<p>If you fancy helping, I've listed the regions <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/euro-elections/issues?labels=help+wanted%2CRegions&amp;page=1&amp;state=open\">on Github here</a>, and added a link to where the results will be published (according to the Electoral Commision's website) - please comment on the region you're planning to submit data for, and once the results are announced, check that council's website for the results, add them to a spreadsheet and submit a pull request.</p>\n<p>Although the European Commission are planning to publish open data on the election results themselves, I'm hoping this will be a nice proof of concept for wider publication of collaborative open data, as well as a starting point for something around next year's general election, which, so far, has never had a single point of reference for open data.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/euro-elections/issues\">open an issue on GitHub</a> or comment below. Happy collaborating!</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{}}

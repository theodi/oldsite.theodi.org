How are you doing?</strong></p>\n<p>Not too bad. Though it’s only Tuesday.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you, or your organisation, do in a nutshell?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m Chief Technical Architect in the BBC Archive Development. My role is to understand how technologies can be used to deliver large scale access to the BBC’s archives. Amongst other things, I’ve been leading development of a platform which brings together linked open data catalogues from a wide range of sources to improve access to digital media in teaching, learning and research.</p>\n<p><strong>What first got you excited about open data?</strong></p>\n<p>Being able to make new stuff without having to ask and wait for somebody’s permission, and the widespread meritocratising effects of <strong>anybody</strong> being able to do that.</p>\n<p><strong>What are your biggest data challenges?</strong></p>\n<p>Convincing people that it’s worth the effort when there are always more important things to do.</p>\n<p><strong>What kind of open data would you like to see more of?</strong></p>\n<p>Everything.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you feel about being nominated for an open data award?</strong></p>\n<p>Fantastic, and more than a little humbled, if I’m honest!</p>\n<p><em>The <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/\">Open Data Awards</a> will be held on July 9 in partnership with Bloomberg at Bloomberg’s London offices on Finsbury Square.</em></p>\n<p><em>Explore all <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/nominations/\">nominees</a> and <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/2015-finalists/\">finalists</a> and follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ODIAwards\">#ODIAwards</a> for updates on the night.</em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"Open Data Awards","url":"http://awards.theodi.org/"}],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/budgit-open-data-nigeria-accountability.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/budgit-open-data-nigeria-accountability","slug":"budgit-open-data-nigeria-accountability","title":"BudgIT: ‘We give Nigerians accessible data, so they can hold leaders to account’","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:02:07+00:00","created_at":"2015-07-08T10:14:45+00:00","tag_ids":["news","open-data-awards","transparency","nigeria","africa","global-development"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/announcing-the-2015-open-data-awards-finalists.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/announcing-the-2015-open-data-awards-finalists","slug":"announcing-the-2015-open-data-awards-finalists","title":"Announcing the 2015 Open Data Awards finalists","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:01:44+00:00","created_at":"2015-06-25T12:53:41+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","open-data-awards"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}}

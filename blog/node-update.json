The last year has seen significant growth: we have welcomed Rio, Devon, Queensland and Athens to the community; our first group of nodes have become <a href=\"http://theodi.org/training_team\">ODI registered trainers</a>; our community of nodes have collaborated with us to deliver <a href=\"http://theodi.org/news/burkina-faso-launches-open-data-initiative-with-mentoring-from-the-odi-and-funding-from-the-world-bank\">global projects</a>; and the network is starting to develop commercial products.</p>\n<p>This year we are introducing a framework of core activities for our nodes. Our ambition is to scale our existing business models - creating repeatable products and activities - to ensure nodes deliver consistent quality across the network. We have worked closely with our community over the past year and identified the key activities they will develop. The new focus will involve two categories of ODI Nodes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Network nodes</strong> - running meet-ups, holding meetings, building an individual membership network</li>\n<li><strong>Learning nodes</strong> - running courses taught by an ODI accredited trainer to teach local businesses and governments about how to work with open data</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"startingthenodenetwork\">Starting the node network</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/23/e2/5523e2eff362be096b000046/10591709146_3cfb883c07_z.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"\" id=\"5523e2eff362be213e00001e\">\nThe Open Data Institute (ODI HQ) opened in 2012 to catalyse open data culture in the UK. By 2013, we had received an overwhelming response from international organisations, many of which wanted to set up a local ODI in their own country, city or area. As a response, we collaborated with this community and built the ODI Node network, focussed on creating global impact from open data. </p>\n<p><strong>This table shows the focus of each node, for 2015:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Learning node</strong> | <strong>Network node</strong> |\nODI North Carolina | ODI North Carolina |\nODI Moscow | ODI Moscow |\nODI Leeds | ODI Leeds |\nODI Devon | ODI Devon |\nODI Sheffield | ODI Sheffield |\nODI Rio de Janeiro | ODI Rio de Janeiro |\nODI Toronto | ODI Toronto |\nODI Queensland | ODI Queensland |\nODI Paris | ODI Osaka |\nODI Athens | ODI Seoul |\nODI Dubai | ODI Brighton |\nODI Buenos Aires | ODI Gothenburg |\nODI Trento | ODI Amsterdam |\n | ODI Manchester |</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Our <a href=\"http://theodi.org/nodes\">ODI Node network</a> is demonstrating how open data is helping to solve problems around the world.

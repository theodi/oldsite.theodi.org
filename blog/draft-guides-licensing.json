The key to openness is <strong>how the data is licensed</strong>. Data that doesn't explicitly have an open licence is not open data.</p>\n<p>Organisations who are publishing data need to understand how to choose and apply a licence to the data that they make available. They ask questions like: \"What does it mean to license data?\", \"What licence should we use?\" and \"How can we indicate the licence that a dataset is available under?\"</p>\n<p>People and companies who are consuming data need to understand what they can legally do with the data that they get access with. They ask questions like: \"What requirements can a licence place on me?\", \"What different licences do publishers use?\" and \"How can we find out what licence a dataset is available under?\"</p>\n<p>We have therefore drafted two guides on licensing, with a particular focus on licensing open data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://personal.crocodoc.com/5PQoIMV\">Draft publisher's guide to licensing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://personal.crocodoc.com/NsmIzfp\">Draft re-user's guide to licensing</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before we publish these guides, we would like to have your feedback on whether they address your questions, and where we could improve them. We've put them on <a href=\"http://personal.crocodoc.com/\">crocodoc</a> so that you can add comments, but feel free to <a href=\"mailto:jeni@theodi.org\">email</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ukodi\">tweet</a> if you prefer. </p>\n<p>We'll later roll your comments into the guides, and publish both the finished guides and a post that summarises the comments we receive.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://personal.crocodoc.com/5PQoIMV\">Comment on the draft publisher's guide</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://personal.crocodoc.com/NsmIzfp\">Comment on the draft re-user's guide</a></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","team","strategy-programme","staff","ceo"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","team","strategy-programme","staff","ceo"]}}

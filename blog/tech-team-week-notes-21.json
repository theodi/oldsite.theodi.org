First on the agenda, was to demo our <a href=\"http://theodi.org/courses\">completed product</a> (currently being populated), and the rest of Monday was devoted to planning for sprint number two.</p>\n<p>For this sprint, we'll be building a membership management system, allowing people and organisations to sign up as members of the ODI (more on that soon!).</p>\n<p>After spending a good portion of time with <a href=\"http://drupal.org/\">Drupal</a> in the previous sprint, I was glad to get back into the world of Ruby, and spent much of Tuesday pairing with James and getting my head around <a href=\"http://cukes.info/\">Cucumber</a>. I had a day out of the office on Wednesday acting as an expert mentor helping voluntary organisations in London get their heads around open data.</p>\n<p>The rest of my week was spent pairing with <a href=\"http://theodi.org/people/tom-heath\">Tom</a> on building a Rails app to take a member's details, ready to pipe into <a href=\"http://www.xero.com/\">Xero</a> (our accounting system) to generate invoices, and add to <a href=\"http://capsulecrm.com/\">Capsule</a> (our CRM system).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/people/sam-pikesley\">Sam</a> got his feet wet with Drupal, as well as doing a sterling job with Tom on migrating the website to a new infrastructure, resulting in less than 3 minutes of downtime, and also giving us a more resilient infrastructure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/people/james-smith\">James</a> spent some time doing knowledge transfer with the rest of the team, and also worked on the design for the Drupal page which will spell out the benefits of becoming a member of the ODI. He put in some ground work for some of the backend work that Tom and I will be picking up on this week.</p>\n<p>Despite a perfect storm of half term week and a poorly child to deal with, <a href=\"http://theodi.org/people/jeni\">Jeni</a> spent some time with Gavin &amp; Stu on Thursday hearing some great pitches for open data stories from our incubees, worked on <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/bootstrap\">ODI-fying</a> <a href=\"http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/\">Twitter Bootstrap</a> to make styling our apps easier, and presented at the <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Women-in-Data/events/97340682/\">Women in Data meetup</a> on Friday evening.</p>","organizations":[],"author":{}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{}}

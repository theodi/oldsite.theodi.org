It has been designed to assess the legislatures of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. In the latest measurements the average country score fell below 40%. Peru and Chile head the table with ratings of just above 50%.</p>\n<p>The index comprises four dimensions: legal regulations which analyses existing regulations on transparency and public access to information; parliamentary work, this category looks at the existence, publication and frequency of distribution of documents concerning parliamentary activity; Budget and administrative management, this dimension analyses the use and management of financial and human resources; and Mechanisms for participation, public engagement and accountability, among other issues, this dimension looks at whether an office or body for civic participation exists.</p>\n<p>As regards the legal regulation dimension, Argentina received a near-average score (46%), while only Peru and Ecuador obtained over 50%. Related to the dimension on parliamentary work, Peru (60%) and Argentina (57%) are on top of the list. All countries, with the exception of Venezuela, produce shorthand transcripts of plenary sessions. \nOn the other hand, parliaments under-performed in the Budget and administrative management dimension, with an average rating barely above 25%. Finally, Peru (68%), Ecuador (68%) and Chile (65%) scored high on Mechanisms for participation, public engagement and accountability, while Argentina ranked last, obtaining only 23%. </p>\n<p>Sandra Elena, Director of the CIPPEC’s Justice Programme said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“This index is a powerful tool for getting comprehensive, detailed data, and in a systematic way, on the reality of our legislatures, while it is a vehicle to ensure true accountability in our parliaments”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>The event was transmitted by streaming in the context of the Open Parliament Week. The complete report can be found at <a href=\"http://www.transparencialegislativa.org\">www.transparencialegislativa.org</a> where it is also possible to download data-sets and questionnaire responses disaggregated by country. The index is posted in open data formats.</em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Sandra Elena","slug":"sandra-elena","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/sandra-elena","tag_ids":["writers","person"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/buenos-aires-node-news-2014.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/buenos-aires-node-news-2014","slug":"buenos-aires-node-news-2014","title":"Buenos Aires  node news: January 2014","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-05-05T09:32:25+00:00","created_at":"2014-01-24T12:48:44+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/friday-lunchtime-lecture-can-open-data-help-unleash-open-government.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures/friday-lunchtime-lecture-can-open-data-help-unleash-open-government","slug":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-can-open-data-help-unleash-open-government","title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: Can open data help unleash open government?","format":"event","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:54:19+00:00","created_at":"2014-01-29T14:20:31+00:00","tag_ids":["event:lunchtime-lecture"],"extras":{"start_date":"2013-06-21T12:00:00+00:00","end_date":"2013-06-21T12:45:00+00:00","location":"Open Data Institute, 65 Clifton Street, London, EC2A 4JE"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/friday-lunchtime-lecture-when-governments-open-up-who-manages-their-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures/friday-lunchtime-lecture-when-governments-open-up-who-manages-their-data","slug":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-when-governments-open-up-who-manages-their-data","title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: When governments open up, who manages their data?","format":"event","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:57:03+00:00","created_at":"2014-09-05T16:17:20+00:00","tag_ids":["event:lunchtime-lecture"],"extras":{"start_date":"2014-09-19T12:00:00+00:00","end_date":"2014-09-19T12:50:00+00:00","location":"The Open Data Institute, 65 Clifton Street, London, EC2A 4JE"}},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/latin-america-paves-the-way-for-smart-cities-and-open-data-startups.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/latin-america-paves-the-way-for-smart-cities-and-open-data-startups","slug":"latin-america-paves-the-way-for-smart-cities-and-open-data-startups","title":"Latin America paves the way for smart cities and open data startups","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:57:26+00:00","created_at":"2014-10-20T14:01:22+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","mexico","smart-cities","training"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/vozdata-argentina.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/vozdata-argentina","slug":"vozdata-argentina","title":"Transforming public documents in Argentina collaboratively","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T09:55:56+00:00","created_at":"2014-06-16T16:01:12+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","argentina","government","crowdsourcing","journalism","data-publication","collaboration"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Sandra Elena","slug":"sandra-elena","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/sandra-elena","tag_ids":["writers","person"]}}

So what happened?</p>\n<p>The week started off for the whole team with the ODI Brand Tech team workshop: a great excercise to distill our core values and flesh out what we believe the ODI stands for.</p>\n<p><strong>Stuart</strong> worked a bit more on bringing the office calendar into production as well as make the development path of the ODI website \"a bit more sane\".</p>\n<p><strong>James</strong> and <strong>Sam</strong> made the <a href=\"http://directory.theodi.org/\">member's directory</a> available; the link, at the moment, remains a placeholder until more content shows up.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeni</strong> worked on the Open Data Certificate and got some really good feedback.</p>\n<p><strong>I</strong> spent some of my time with the newly released <a href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/\">R 3.0.0</a> and added a list of editorial comments to the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-vocab-data-cube-20130312/\">W3C Data Cube</a> vocabulary.</p>\n<p>Lastly, a great <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s\">80s</a> fad is back with the <strong>Rubik's Cube</strong> making frequent appearances in our office. If you want to get started, the internet hosts oodles of guides â€“ perhaps one of the more visual explanations comes from the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2008/12/16/science/20081216_RUBIK_GRAPHIC.html\">New York Times</a>.</p>","organizations":[],"author":{}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{}}

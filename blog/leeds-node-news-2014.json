however we will have a “Pop-Up” location when we formally launch in the new year and with the enthusiasm already shown, we’ll be on a permanent footing by the middle of the year.</p>\n<p>So our <strong>priorities</strong> for the New Year are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Build a membership model alongside the ODI membership model that suits the context of Leeds and the City Region.</p></li>\n<li><p>Create shared value from Open Data - using Civic partnerships - with a start-up and investment model for acceleration.</p></li>\n<li><p>Events - very possibly in collaboration with the other ODI-Nodes in the North of England and organisations like <a href=\"http://www.leedsdatathing.co.uk/\">Leeds Data Thing</a> , The Bradford Public Data Platform, and the forthcoming data platform <a href=\"http://www.leedsdatamill.org/\">Leeds Data Mill</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Training - take the ODI training collateral and use it here in Yorkshire.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In our discussions so far it has been interesting to see how four areas of <strong>focus</strong> have emerged, which are;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Energy &amp; Environment - particularly in terms of energy saving – we know there are quick wins in terms of financial outcomes, fuel poverty and communities where we can have a real impact.</p></li>\n<li><p>Health and Care - Amplify the great work already happening with the Leeds Health Innovation Lab the NHS and the Health &amp; Medical businesses in the region. </p></li>\n<li><p>Civic Innovation – helping our public institutions with Open-Data , Innovation, creating a shared value for our communities. </p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>We will be using these to establish ourselves and expect many more to be built alongside these starting points.</p>\n<p>Finally I’d like to say thanks to all who have offered their support over the last few weeks, and to say that, if you, your organisation or business would like to play a part in what the ODI could be in Leeds and the region please get in touch with us.</p>\n<p>Best way is probably twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ODILeeds\" title=\"@ODI-Leeds\">@ODI-Leeds</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ActuatedFutures\" title=\"@actuatedfutures\">@actuatedfutures</a>, or by email to paul@actuatedfutures</p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/leeds.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/nodes/leeds","slug":"leeds","title":"Leeds","format":"node","updated_at":"2017-05-22T13:48:30+00:00","created_at":"2013-10-28T15:41:56+00:00","tag_ids":["node","leeds"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

How are you doing?</strong></p>\n<p>For a Monday morning, my spirits are high. Obviously because I have the ODI Awards to look forward to later this week. </p>\n<p><strong>What do you, or your organisation, do in a nutshell?</strong></p>\n<p>My team makes sure that the Mayor of London has all the data he needs to form strategies and policies in a world city. Part of our job is to run and develop the London Datastore into a world class open data platform.</p>\n<p><strong>What first got you excited about open data?</strong></p>\n<p>The possibility of using data to answer city problems and create things that make people’s lives easier. </p>\n<p><strong>What are your biggest data challenges?</strong></p>\n<p>Supply and culture. There is so much of the stuff in London, and making sure it is a) shared and then b) shared in a harmonised, interoperable and meaningful way is my biggest frustration. With more coordination and cooperation we have a much better chance to address issues which pay no attention to the artificial administrative boundaries which cross the city. </p>\n<p><strong>What kind of open data would you like to see more of?</strong></p>\n<p>More of what I call ‘city data’ – from the water companies, the utilities, the electricity companies. These are becoming increasingly valuable because they are central to the city issues we face. So from a broad city resilience perspective, how do you use data to smooth the peaks and troughs of energy demand to become a more efficient city; and from a consumer perspective, how do you give people the proper means to change their consumption patterns and drive good deals with energy companies?</p>\n<p><strong>How do you feel about being nominated for an open data award?</strong></p>\n<p>Delighted. To win would lend considerable weight to our arguments and would help move the London City Data team more towards centre stage, which is where we want to be.</p>\n<p><em>The <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/\">Open Data Awards</a> will be held on July 9 in partnership with Bloomberg at Bloomberg’s London offices on Finsbury Square.</em></p>\n<p><em>Explore all <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/nominations/\">nominees</a> and <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/2015-finalists/\">finalists</a> and follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ODIAwards\">#ODIAwards</a> for updates on the night.</em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"Open Data Awards","url":"http://awards.theodi.org/"}],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/budgit-open-data-nigeria-accountability.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/budgit-open-data-nigeria-accountability","slug":"budgit-open-data-nigeria-accountability","title":"BudgIT: ‘We give Nigerians accessible data, so they can hold leaders to account’","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:02:07+00:00","created_at":"2015-07-08T10:14:45+00:00","tag_ids":["news","open-data-awards","transparency","nigeria","africa","global-development"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/announcing-the-2015-open-data-awards-finalists.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/announcing-the-2015-open-data-awards-finalists","slug":"announcing-the-2015-open-data-awards-finalists","title":"Announcing the 2015 Open Data Awards finalists","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:01:44+00:00","created_at":"2015-06-25T12:53:41+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","open-data-awards"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/denis-gursky-apps-making-ukraine-better-country.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/denis-gursky-apps-making-ukraine-better-country","slug":"denis-gursky-apps-making-ukraine-better-country","title":"Denis Gursky: ‘Apps are making Ukraine a better country'","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:01:51+00:00","created_at":"2015-07-08T21:49:43+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","open-data-awards","open-data","ukraine"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}}

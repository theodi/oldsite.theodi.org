The following week we also saw the announcement that the G8 have signed up to an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-data-charter/\">Open Data Charter</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The World Bank have <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/speech/2013/06/15/remarks-world-bank-managing-director-closing-plenary-g8-conference\">committed</a> to opening up all its contract data and corporate registries. Combined with aggressive statements about tracking down tax avoidance, we could see the coming together of objectives with material impact using open data as the instrument of change.</p>\n<p>The big questions to me are: is it rhetoric that will lead to the release of benign data, or will it catalyse real change?</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/legacy/standard%2Dcert.png\" alt=\"Open Data Certificates\" /><strong><a href=\"http://certificates.theODI.org\">http://certificates.theODI.org</a></strong></p>\n<p>I presented the ODI’s new <a href=\"http://certificates.theodi.org\">Open Data Certificates</a> at the Summit as the first robust badge for publishing open data. We believe the it is a tangible way to measure some of the commitments in the Charter.</p>\n<p>The rhetoric at the Summit was very aligned with our perspective at the ODI: that we face unprecedented challenges as a society: a scaling population, our environmental security, our economic stability and growth. These are issues unique to our time. I believe that;</p>\n<p><em>Open data is an enabler of freedom: to trade, to learn, to be secure,   \nto our well-being as individuals, organisations, and as countries.</em></p>\n<p>Much as the web of open documents has catalysed innovation around the world over the last 20 years, the web of open data will help us address local and global challenges. Open data helps us tackle these issues at scale: fostering collaboration, connecting information, and providing transparency.</p>\n<p><em>As we unlock the data we can tell the story of how</em><br />\n<em>open information, transformed into insight, changes the world.</em></p>\n<p>I have watched the evolution of open data culture over the past 20 years: from grassroots initiatives, to innovative groups like <a href=\"http://www.mysociety.org/\">MySociety</a> and <a href=\"http://okfn.org/\">OKF</a>, to the creation last year of the <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org\">ODI</a>. Seeing the G8 sign the first <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-data-charter/\">Open Data Charter</a> this week, leads me to think we are seeing a coming of age of open data:</p>\n<p><em>“a new era in which people can use open data to generate   \n insights, ideas, and services to create a better world for all.”   \n[G8 Open Data Charter]</em></p>\n<p>I am reminded of the words of <a href=\"http://www.oblomovka.com/\">Danny O’Brien</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mysociety.org/about-tom-steinberg/\">Tom Steinberg</a> and <a href=\"http://tom.loosemore.com/\">Tom Loosemore</a> in their <a href=\"http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/govt-broken-citizen-scrutiny-bugfix\">descriptions</a> of how to fix government:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Identify broken civic institution</li>\n<li>Liberate data from said institution</li>\n<li>Build civic tool too useful to turn off</li>\n<li>Leave for X years</li>\n<li>Watch institution adapt</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Getting open data anywhere near the agenda of the G8 in less than one lifetime seems, therefore, a minor miracle. It is also a reflection of the pace of change that is now possible, and one that will accelerate in our ‘always connected’, increasingly data literate society.</p>\n<p>We need to be aware of the road ahead. While the rhetoric on open is clear, realising impact in any material way will be a difficult journey.</p>\n<p><em>By making open data integral to their approach, the G8 can address its objectives on   \neconomic growth, tax, transparency, trade, and commitments on land and extractives.</em></p>\n<p>In the UK, where we claim some leadership, we have found it impossible to release critical open data assets, such as the country’s legal addresses, or the boundary data relating to land titles, or basic environmental data such as national flood data.</p>\n<p>This does not send a positive signal to anyone that our ambitions match reality. We need to work together on addressing the blockers: understanding people’s concerns, providing training, transforming commercial models, enabling people to innovate, and taking risks.</p>\n<p><em>Transformation never comes without disruption.</em><br />\n<em>So, disruption is also the new normal.</em></p>\n<p>We need strong leadership, not just from politicians, but from the commercial sector, academia, and the third sector. Failure to engage in this new normal introduces risk to your organisation. Creative engagement will help open up models for both transition and innovation.</p>\n<p>The right frameworks, processes, tools will help but , above all else, by investing in people we can engage with each other, with citizens, organisations and governments to deliver powerful insights that enable change. If we believe there is gold, we need miners.</p>\n<p>I am reminded of the impact of the Millennium Development Goals:</p>\n<p><em>“The Millennium Development Goals have proven that</em><br />\n<em>focused global development objectives can make a profound difference”</em><br />\n[<a href=\"http://www.unric.org/en/latest-un-buzz/28597-big-strides-on-millennium-development-goals-with-more-targets-achievable-by-2015-un-report\">UNRIC</a>]</p>\n<p>Enabling a global network of experts to help us catalyse challenge is at the heart of the ODI’s agenda, and the whole team here is genuinely excited to be part of it. We look forward to meeting you.</p>\n<p>This is [still] the beginning of the journey.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>Open Data is good for America [Todd Park and Steven VanRoekel]<br />\n[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steven-vanroekel/open-data-is-good-for-ame<em>b</em>3354451.html](Huffington post)</p>\n<p>Why we should welcome a G8 Open Data Charter [Martin Tisne]<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/10125211/Why-we-should-welcome-a-G8-Open-Data-Charter.html\">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/10125211/Why-we-should-welcome-a-G8-Open-Data-Charter.html</a></p>\n<p>G8 Open Data Charter: why it matters [Nigel Shadbolt]<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/g8/10128266/G8-Open-Data-Charter-why-it-matters.html\">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/g8/10128266/G8-Open-Data-Charter-why-it-matters.html</a></p>\n<p>G8 Open Data Charter Highlights Open Data as Crucial for Governance and Growth [Rufus Pollock]<br />\n<a href=\"http://blog.okfn.org/2013/06/18/g8-highlights-open-data-as-crucial-for-governance-and-growth/\">http://blog.okfn.org/2013/06/18/g8-highlights-open-data-as-crucial-for-governance-and-growth/</a></p>\n<p>The Independent<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/g8-open-data-charter-will-increase-transparency-and-fuel-innovation-8665696.html\">http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/g8-open-data-charter-will-increase-transparency-and-fuel-innovation-8665696.html</a></p>\n<p>TechWorld<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.techworld.com/incubator/2013/06/g8-commitment-to-open-data-is-good-news-for-entrepreneurs/index.htm\">http://blogs.techworld.com/incubator/2013/06/g8-commitment-to-open-data-is-good-news-for-entrepreneurs/index.htm</a></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{}}

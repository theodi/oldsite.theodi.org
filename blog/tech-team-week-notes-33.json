It ended with a great conference on Saturday:\u0002<a href=\"http://opentech.org.uk/2013/\">Open Tech</a>.\u0002Despite being on the weekend, you could find most of the ODI tech team there. It's safe to say that the conference was a great success with plenty of interesting and inspiring talks.</p>\n<p>Jeni attended the Open Data User Group meeting, where we presented an updated benefits case for opening up a specific data set. She also went to\u0002the\u0002<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shakespeare-review-of-public-sector-information\">Shakespeare Review</a>\u0002launch and spoke at the <a href=\"http://www.eduserv.org.uk/newsandevents/events/2013/symposium#Speakers\">Eduserve Symposium</a>.\u0002On Friday, Jeni sat in on White October's user testing of the\u0002<a href=\"http://theodi.github.io/open-data-certificate/\">Open Data Certificate</a>.</p>\n<p>Sam had a rather frustrating week working with Drupal. We hope that his and our woes are soon over.\u0002James and Stuart spent also time working on the\u0002<a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/dataset-metadata-survey\">Dataset Metadata Survey</a>.</p>\n<p>Tom spend most of his days for\u0002background work on an European project proposals. He and I also worked on a guide on how to publish big data. We plan to share more at the end of the next sprint.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we are virtually ready to start our first research project!</p>","organizations":[],"author":{}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{}}

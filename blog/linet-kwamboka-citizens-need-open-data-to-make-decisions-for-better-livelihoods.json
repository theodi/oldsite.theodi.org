How are you doing?</strong></p>\n<p>Hey, I am doing very well thanks!</p>\n<p><strong>What do you, or your organisation, do in a nutshell?</strong></p>\n<p>I am the Founder and CEO of DataScience LTD, a software engineering company focused on innovating data for analytics and research for better decision making, resource allocation and profit making. I am also the project coordinator for the Kenya Open data initiative, a government initiative that is focused in making data publicly and freely accessible.</p>\n<p><strong>What first got you excited about open data?</strong></p>\n<p>The simple reason that governments and organisations make public information that is vital for development and information that helps businesses and citizens make critical decisions for better livelihoods, resource allocation and business processes.</p>\n<p><strong>What are your biggest data challenges?</strong></p>\n<p>Access to business process information and information that is not in accessible and useable formats.</p>\n<p><strong>What kind of open data would you like to see more of?</strong></p>\n<p>Open data about business processes, government regulations and consumption and production data from manufacturing.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you feel about being nominated for an open data award?</strong></p>\n<p>It is a great honour to be recognised in this category and, for me, this is a great opportunity to showcase the amazing work that we do. This nomination keeps telling me that no matter what, time and chance are given to us all.</p>\n<p><em>The <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/\">Open Data Awards</a> will be held on July 9 in partnership with Bloomberg at Bloomberg’s London offices on Finsbury Square.</em></p>\n<p><em>Explore all <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/nominations/\">nominees</a> and <a href=\"http://awards.theodi.org/2015-finalists/\">finalists</a> and follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ODIAwards\">#ODIAwards</a> for updates on the night.</em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"Open Data Awards","url":"http://awards.theodi.org/"}],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/mo-mcroberts-open-data-anyone-can-use.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/mo-mcroberts-open-data-anyone-can-use","slug":"mo-mcroberts-open-data-anyone-can-use","title":"Mo McRoberts: ‘The best thing about open data is that anyone can use it'","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:02:10+00:00","created_at":"2015-07-08T21:42:43+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","open-data","open-data-awards","bbc"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/budgit-open-data-nigeria-accountability.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/budgit-open-data-nigeria-accountability","slug":"budgit-open-data-nigeria-accountability","title":"BudgIT: ‘We give Nigerians accessible data, so they can hold leaders to account’","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:02:07+00:00","created_at":"2015-07-08T10:14:45+00:00","tag_ids":["news","open-data-awards","transparency","nigeria","africa","global-development"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/announcing-the-2015-open-data-awards-finalists.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/announcing-the-2015-open-data-awards-finalists","slug":"announcing-the-2015-open-data-awards-finalists","title":"Announcing the 2015 Open Data Awards finalists","format":"article","updated_at":"2015-09-11T10:01:44+00:00","created_at":"2015-06-25T12:53:41+00:00","tag_ids":["blog","open-data-awards"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Anna Scott","slug":"anna-scott","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/anna-scott","tag_ids":["team","culture-programme"]}}

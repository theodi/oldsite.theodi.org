(Stuart doesn't start properly until later in February, but he managed to join us for a couple of days early last week.)</p>\n<p>Our first two days together were spent learning about ODI and each other, and exploring how we want to work together and with the wider community. Our aims include being open by default, reusing and collaborating around other people's work, and listening as well as talking.</p>\n<p>To those ends, we've had a busy week, among other things</p>\n<ul>\n<li>setting up <a href=\"irc://irc.freenode.net/theodi\">an IRC channel</a> (come hang out!) and a <a href=\"http://hubot.github.com/\">Hubot</a></li>\n<li>getting the <a href=\"http://twitter.com/UKODITech\">@UKODITech</a> twitter account set up</li>\n<li>getting <a href=\"http://jenkins.theodi.org/\">Jenkins</a> running and public</li>\n<li>learning <a href=\"http://zachholman.com/talk/how-github-uses-github-to-build-github/\">how github use github to build github</a></li>\n<li>creating our <a href=\"https://www.leftronic.com/share/g/OqF269/\">dev dashboard</a> (also public)</li>\n<li>recabling our <a href=\"http://twitter.yfrog.com/nu3fqpfj\">rack</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are in an incredibly privileged position, lacking legacy systems, with money to buy the kit and services we need, and with organisational support to be able to work as we want to work.

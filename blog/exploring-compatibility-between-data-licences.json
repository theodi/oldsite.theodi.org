We've already received some welcome feedback \u0002which has resulted in updates to the guides and the <a href=\"http://schema.theodi.org/odrs/\">Open Data Rights Statement</a> schema. If you've not looked at the material \u0002yet then please let us know if you have comments.</p>\n<p>The\u0002 schema, along with the <a href=\"http://theodi.org/guide/publishers-guide-open-data-licensing\">publisher</a> and <a href=\"http://theodi.org/guide/reusers-guide-open-data-licensing\">re-user</a>\u0002 guides to open data licensing, provides \u0002some useful advice for anyone looking to publish or use open data. Ensuring that your rights statement is machine-readable is also a key part of achieving a higher <a href=\"http://certificate.theodi.org\">certification for your dataset</a>.</p>\n<p>However there are still some \u0002areas in which we've found that people need more guidance around the implications of open data licences:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>how does an open licence affect your ability to create new, derived datasets?</li>\n<li>what are the implications for mixing together data and content that are covered by different open licences?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These issues are particularly relevant for people looking to build <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/guide/how-make-business-case-open-data\">business models</a> around open data, which often involve combining and enriching data from multiple sources. While it can be obvious \u0002how a licence might support building a product on a dataset, the implications of combining data published under \u0002different licences \u0002are not always clear.</p>\n<p>To help address this we've put together <a href=\"https://github.com/theodi/open-data-licensing/blob/master/guides/licence-compatibility.md\">an introductory document on \"licence compatibility\"</a>. This document and the supporting matrices attempt to provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a summary of the key facets of the most common open data licences</li>\n<li>a discussion of the issues and use cases around licence compatibility</li>\n<li>a matrix describing\u0002 which \u0002licences can be used when publishing derived datasets based upon a single source</li>\n<li>a matrix describing how\u0002 datasets derived from multiple sources might \u0002be licensed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The document builds on\u0002 previous work by the Creative Commons, extending\u0002 it to include licences from the Open Data Commons and the UK public sector. \u0002The ultimate goal is to have a clearer set of guidance to support these use cases along with some tools to help guide people towards choosing the best licence for their work.\u0002</p>\n<p>The document is still at an early stage and would benefit from review and feedback from the wider community. \u0002We would love\u0002 to hear your feedback on the work to date.

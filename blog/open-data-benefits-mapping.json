We see they have a bunch of <a href=\"http://opendatainstitute.org/stories\">open data stories</a> and also some <a href=\"http://opendatainstitute.org/case-studies\">case studies</a>, which contain some good examples (which we have stolen some of the content of) but they are organised as anecdotes (well, obviously!) rather than the structured thing we wanted. </p>\n<p>As a Node we enjoy a good relationship with ODI HQ so a few tweets were exchanged and we were soon put in touch with their Head of Research, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tommyh\">Tom Heath</a>, who had an outline “Impact matrix” that looks interesting (and which we have also now stolen) and the lead technical architect for the Glasgow Future Cities demonstrator, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/colinbirchenall\">Colin Birchenall</a>, who also had some useful insights (which we have also stolen).</p>\n<p><em>[There’s a theme developing here - Ed.]</em></p>\n<p>Anyway, we have now started the process of putting all this stuff together, and thinking it through properly. It seems we are basically aiming at a simple list of stakeholder groups – citizens, families, small business, small charities, bigger businesses, councils, government departments etc – with at least one identified benefit for each, and the dependencies – the things that need to be in place for that benefit to be realised.</p>\n<p>So <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RmAm9YTwsdiz25Fju_-RTFN4LG7SzZKhmNKm_HoAFJ4/edit?usp=sharing\">here’s a spreadsheet showing what we mean</a>.

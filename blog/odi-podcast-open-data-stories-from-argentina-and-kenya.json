of <a href=\"http://opendataday.org/\">Open Data Day</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/linet-kwamboka-7a783b1b/\">Linet Kwamboka</a> and <a href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/users/sandra-elena\">Sandra Elena</a> share stories from their experiences running open data initiatives in different contexts. </p>\n<p><strong>Linet Kwamboka</strong> is coordinator of <a href=\"https://opendata.go.ke/\">Kenya’s Open Data Initiative</a>. </p>\n<p><img

id=\"58b84557d0d462069200007a\"></p>\n<p>With a background in computer science and software engineering, Linet's 'impressive amounts of geekiness' took her from consulting for the World Bank to coordinating Kenya's national open data initiative. </p>\n<p>In promoting open data in government, here Linet shares how important dataviz and blogging have been to proving it isn't 'just about transparency', and how policy and community engagement are as important as technology. </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Sandra Elena</strong> is coordinator of the <a

encourages justice institutions to publish open data, one strategy being to feature it on a participatory platform for key stakeholders – from businesses to community groups – to help define justice priorities.   </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In the second part of the podcast, Linet and Sandra discuss equality of opportunity in the tech sectors of Argentina and Kenya and how it can be improved, along with their experiences as <a href=\"http://theodi.org/tags/women-in-data\">women in data</a> and visions for the future.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><img

We will be focusing our efforts in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development/about\">developing countries</a> in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. </p>\n<p>As a global centre of open data expertise, the ODI will co-lead the project alongside one of the world leaders in agriculture and nutrition research, <a href=\"https://www.wageningenur.nl/en.htm\">Wageningen University</a> in the Netherlands. </p>\n<p>We will also lead two key pieces of work in the project, focusing on open data standards and innovative training products. Our deputy CEO <a href=\"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison\">Jeni Tennison</a> and our <a href=\"http://theodi.org/labs\">Labs team</a> will be researching how to address the existing gaps in open data standards in agriculture and nutrition, and provide recommendations on how to bridge those gaps. Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://theodi.org/team/simon-bullmore\">Simon Bullmore</a> and the ODI Learning team will be developing new online training courses, and novel methods to bring learning to a wider audience. </p>\n<p>The project will also explore different methods of evaluating the impact of two types of initiatives: projects that aim to improve agriculture and nutrition, and interventions that trigger innovation. </p>\n<p>This will complement the great strides being made by <a href=\"http://www.godan.info/\">GODAN</a> to build a partnership of over 300 organisations working with open data and agriculture and nutrition. At the ODI, we have been working on data in <a href=\"http://theodi.org/agriculture-nutrition-open-data\">agriculture and nutrition</a> for over a year, and this project will enable us to have a global impact with our work. </p>\n<p>Following the recent <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2016\">World Bank report</a> on the digital divide, this project will be crucial in ensuring those working in agriculture and nutrition in developing countries can benefit from open data. Given our mission statement – to ‘connect, equip and inspire people around the world to innovate with data’ – we are keen to develop new tools, standards and training products that can support farmers, infomediaries and policymakers to harness its potential. </p>\n<p>GODAN Action is funded by the UK’s Department for International Development.

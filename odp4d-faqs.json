Initial funding of $1.25 million in the first year comes from The World Bankâ€™s Development Grant Facility. We are actively seeking additional partners to join our efforts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatarethepartnershipobjectives\">What are the Partnership objectives?</h3>\n<p><strong>1. Supporting developing countries to plan, execute and run open data initiatives</strong></p>\n<p><em>Officials in developing countries are recognizing the potential impacts of open data. They are looking for a range of support to assess their current readiness and to plan and execute national open data strategies.</em></p>\n<p><strong>2. Increase re-use of open data in developing countries</strong></p>\n<p><em>Create data standards, guidelines, regional networks and demand-side capacity. Data should be in a usable, well documented form, and there has to be an ecosystem of skills, support and peer learning to help bring about social and economic innovation.</em></p>\n<p><strong>3. Grow the base of evidence on the impact of open data for development</strong></p>\n<p><em>There needs to be a credible evidence base focused on developing countries and socio-economic development in order to both win the support of officials and to better execute future open data initiatives.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"wherewilltheopendatapartnershipfordevelopmentbeimplemented\">Where will the Open Data Partnership for Development be implemented?</h3>\n<p>The ODP4D's activities will be directed towards developing countries, as <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications/country-and-lending-groups\">defined by The World Bank</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatwilltheprogrammesentail\">What will the programmes entail?</h3>\n<p>The objectives of the programme are to support developing countries to plan, execute and run open data initiatives, to increase re-use of open data in developing countries, to develop an ecosystem of skills, support and peer-learning, and grow the base of evidence on the impact of open data for development.</p>\n<p>Open Data Institute and Open Knowledge Foundation will co-lead a scoping, research, and communications plan. In addition, we will implement Open Data Readiness Assessments and create guidelines and standards. Concurrent training and networking programmes will be offered by each organization.

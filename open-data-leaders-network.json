It is supported by the International Development Research Centre as part of the OD4D network and the European Commission.\nOur first cohort launched in February 2015 with participants from countries including the UK, Chile, Morocco, and Macedonia – each responsible for the implementation of their government’s open data initiatives. </p>\n<p>A further set of open data leaders attended the second cohort of the network in July 2015. This group featured individuals from a diverse range of national, sub-national and city-wide roles including representatives from Buenos Aires to New Zealand. </p>\n<p>The week-long ODLN programme brings participants to the ODI’s London offices to engage with our world-class trainers and resources. While here, leaders also encounter other members of the global open data community including the Centre for Public Impact at the Boston Consulting Group, UK Transparency Board member Andrew Stott, and entrepreneurs in the ODI’s own Startup programme.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Future cohorts of the Open Data Leaders Network will take place in London during 2016.

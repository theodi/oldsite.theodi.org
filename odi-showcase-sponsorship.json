Each competition runs for around six months, during which the ODI:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>gathers applications for potential projects, assesses their suitability and selects projects to receive a £7,000 award</p></li>\n<li><p>works with successful projects to help refine their story, including, as necessary, help with research and analysis and with communicating the value of the project to their target audience</p></li>\n<li><p>communicates the story into mainstream media to ensure the project has a wide impact</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The 2015 ODI Showcase featured four projects, two of which have reached fruition:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow\">Breathe Heathrow</a> uses air quality sensors to help residents understand how the airport affects their area, bringing more data into the hands of communities to address local needs.

Their work was picked up in almost <strong>20 media outlets</strong>, including local newspapers and ITV News, with a combined <strong>reach of almost 15 million people</strong>.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"howcanyousponsortheodishowcase\">How can you sponsor the ODI Showcase?</h3>\n<p>Sponsoring the ODI Showcase provides a unique opportunity to demonstrate your support for data innovation.</p>\n<p>This year we are offering three levels of sponsorship for the ODI Showcase:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Showcase partner</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The competition will be referred to in all ODI communications as the <strong>ODI Showcase in partnership with XXX</strong> and successful projects will be described as <strong>supported by the ODI and XXX</strong>.</p></li>\n<li><p>We are only accepting a single showcase partner for each call. </p></li>\n<li><p>You may cross-publish and cross-promote all showcase content on your site.</p></li></ul></li>\n<li><p><strong>Story sponsor</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Providing this level of sponsorship enables us to support more projects through the ODI Showcase competition.</p></li>\n<li><p>You can set the theme of the projects that you will sponsor and <strong>help select the successful project within that theme</strong>.</p></li>\n<li><p>The successful project will be described as <strong>supported by the ODI and XXX through the ODI Showcase</strong>.</p></li>\n<li><p>This sponsorship is only available prior to the call for applications for the competition.</p></li></ul></li>\n<li><p><strong>Project sponsor</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Providing this level of sponsorship helps support selected projects within the ODI Showcase.</p></li>\n<li><p>You can choose which unsponsored project to support.</p></li>\n<li><p>That project will be described as <strong>supported by the ODI and XXX through the ODI Showcase</strong>.</p></li>\n<li><p>This sponsorship is available after projects are selected and prior to their communication.</p></li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>If you are interested in sponsoring the ODI Showcase in any of these ways, please email <a href=\"mailto:showcase@theodi.org\">showcase@theodi.org</a>.</strong></em></p>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/summer-showcase.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase","slug":"summer-showcase","title":"ODI Showcase 2015 ","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-04-06T16:15:43+00:00","created_at":"2015-07-06T14:41:33+00:00","tag_ids":["page","summer-showcase","stories","odi-showcase"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-supporter.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi-supporter","slug":"odi-supporter","title":"Membership for organisations","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-07-21T09:40:22+00:00","created_at":"2014-03-18T13:00:19+00:00","tag_ids":["members","members","page","membership","supporters"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

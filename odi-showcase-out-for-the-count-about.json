This tracker crowdsourced results live from counts taking place across the country as they came in, with the help of volunteer ‘Count Correspondents’.</p>\n     <p>Out for the Count is a project run in partnership between the <a href=\"http://www.lgiu.org.uk/\" title=\"Local Government Information Unit\">Local Government Information Unit</a> (LGiU) and <a href=\"https://democracyclub.org.uk/\" title=\"Democracy Club\">Democracy Club.</a></p>\n     <p>Both the LGiU and Democracy Club are dedicated to improving democracy. The LGiU covers local elections as part of its wider local government work. Democracy Club helps open up data to make better digital services for citizens.</p>\n     <p>Out for the Count’s vision is to help speed up the feedback loop for voters, so if they vote, they can understand the impact their vote had. This helps to support the broader aim of ensuring greater transparency in local elections and more-informed choices for voters.</p>\n     <p>The crowdsourced database of results that was collected by the team and volunteer Count Correspondents is now accessible as a <a href=\"https://candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/uk_results/councils\" title=\"General Election results\">full list of the results</a> and an <a href=\"https://candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/\" title=\"Interactive map of General Election results\">interactive map</a>, hosted by Democracy Club.</p>\n     <p>In support of open elections around the world, the Out for the Count results tracker can be used again for elections everywhere. The Out for the Count team plans to further refine and use the model they have developed during by-elections over the next year, and for the local elections in 2017.</p>\n\n     <h3>The Out for the Count team</h3>\n     <ul>\n      <li>Sym Roe, Director, Democracy Club CIC</li>\n      <li>Joe Mitchell, Coordinator, Democracy Club CIC</li>\n      <li>Charlotte Maddix, Partnerships Development Officer, LGiU</li>\n      <li>Ingrid Koehler, Senior Policy Researcher, LGiU</li>\n     </ul>\n\n     <p></p>\n     <a href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-background\" title=\"Next page\"><img class=\"pull-right\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/16/43/56164300f362be08b400000f/summer_showcase_next_but.svg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n  </div>\n\n<div class=\"pull-left col-md-3\">\n  <div class=\"blog-box-opacity\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about\">About</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-background\">Background</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about-the-data\">About the data</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-methdology\">Methodology</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about-collaboration\">Collaboration</a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-showcase-out-for-the-count-about-what-next\">What next?</a>\n  </div>\n\n  </div>\n</div>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

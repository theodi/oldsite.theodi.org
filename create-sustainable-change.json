We have developed a culture change framework and open data readiness assessment based on research into organisational change and insights from civil servants leading change in governments around the world, from Mexico to Macedonia, Kenya to Chile. These are translated into Arabic, French, Russian, simplified Chinese Mandarin and Spanish, and use by researchers and academics around the world.</p>\n<p>Our work is underpinned by research and insights from clients in businesses and governments around the world. The ODI was co-founded in 2012 by the inventor of the web Sir Tim Berners-Lee and AI expert Sir Nigel Shadbolt to address today’s global challenges using the web of data.</p>\n<p><a class=\"btn btn-info btn-lg \" href=\"mailto:bizdev@theodi.org\">Get in touch</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Contact us</strong></p>\n<p>We’d love to talk to you about how we can help you to upskill your team.

The <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/topics/sustainabledevelopmentgoals\" title=\"Sustainable Development Goals\">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs) address major global issues of justice, human rights, social inclusion, prosperity and the environment.</p>\n<p>This is a critical time for country governments, donors, business, NGOs, academia and the open data community to consider how open data can be applied to achieve development targets.</p>\n<p>While open data can be used to benefit many areas, this report identifies three where it could have a significant impact in the next development agenda and beyond.</p>\n<p>Open data can: <strong>i) more effectively target aid money and improve development programmes, ii) track development progress and prevent corruption,</strong> and <strong>iii) contribute to innovation, job creation and economic growth.</strong></p>\n<p>To achieve these aims, the development community must address many <strong>challenges</strong>, including: a weak enabling environment for open data publishing; poor data quality; a mismatch between the demand for open data and the supply of appropriate datasets; a ‘digital divide’ between rich and poor, affecting both the supply and use of data; and a general lack of quantifiable data and metrics.</p>\n<p>With these challenges in mind, the report sets out ways that governments, donors and (international) NGOs – with the support of researchers, civil society and industry – can apply open data to help make the SDGs a reality:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Reach global consensus around principles and standards</strong>, namely being ‘open by default’, using the <a href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/groups/opendata\" title=\"Open Government Partnership’s Open Data Working Group\">Open Government Partnership’s Open Data Working Group</a> as a global forum for discussion.</li>\n<li><strong>Embed open data into funding agreements</strong>, ensuring that relevant, high-quality data is collected to report against the SDGs. Funders should mandate that data relating to performance of services, and data produced as a result of funded activity, be released as open data. </li>\n<li><strong>Build a global partnership for sustainable open data</strong>, so that groups across the public and private sectors can work together to build sustainable supply and demand for data in the developing world. </li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<iframe style=\"max-width:100%;\" class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/255317927/content?start_page=1&view_mode=slideshow&access_key=key-Pa6Zq69qH3ANyCqCUjVX&show_recommendations=false\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7080062794348508\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_92557\" width=\"600px\" height=\"880px\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[{"title":"Find out how open data can be used to support sustainable development here","url":"https://www.scribd.com/document_downloads/255317927?extension=pdf&from=embed&source=embed"}],"related":[{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/global-development-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/global-development-open-data","slug":"global-development-open-data","title":"Global development","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-10-31T15:13:28+00:00","created_at":"2015-09-25T15:41:46+00:00","tag_ids":["page","global-development"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/method-report-peer-networks-for-open-data-leaders.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/method-report-peer-networks-for-open-data-leaders","slug":"method-report-peer-networks-for-open-data-leaders","title":"Method report: Peer networks for open data leaders","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-06-10T13:25:39+00:00","created_at":"2016-04-20T21:14:38+00:00","tag_ids":["page","peer-network","global-development","services","method-report"]},{"id":"https://contentapi.theodi.org/method-report-lessons-on-supporting-public-sector-open-data-leadership.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/method-report-lessons-on-supporting-public-sector-open-data-leadership","slug":"method-report-lessons-on-supporting-public-sector-open-data-leadership","title":"Method report: Supporting public sector open data leadership","format":"article","updated_at":"2016-04-28T16:43:31+00:00","created_at":"2016-04-21T06:28:09+00:00","tag_ids":["page","public-sector","method-report","services"]}],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

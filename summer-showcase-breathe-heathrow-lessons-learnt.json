However, this can be counteracted to some extent by calibration and good algorithms, as is the case for the <i>Air Quality Egg</i>. The Version 2 Egg, which [we] used, is far superior to the earlier design.</blockquote>\n    <p><b>– James Moulding, community manager at OpenSensors and <i>Breathe Heathrow</i> team member</b></p>\n    <p>With a small team and limited resources, the <i>Breathe Heathrow</i> project came across several challenges to ensuring consistent data from its air quality and noise sensors. </p>\n    <p>To maintain its air sensor devices, <i>Breathe Heathrow</i> relied on a network of volunteers and a project manager to visit them and deal with issues such as wifi connectivity problems, minor hardware faults and software updates. This worked well in some cases, but not in others where volunteers with sensors did not follow instructions or guidelines.</p>\n    <blockquote>Maintenance of sensors networks is complex and there are many points of failure. We learned that remote management and support is necessary going forward when dealing with community-driven projects.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote>Some participants changed their wifi router passwords, only to find their sensor, which was dependent on that connection, to then be non-functional. When this happened, instead of using the Egg’s interface to remedy the issue, a member of the <i>Breathe Heathrow</i> team had to venture out to make the simple adjustment. This level of maintenance would not be sustainable for larger deployments.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote>Software updating on the <i>Air Quality Egg</i> is another issue we have faced. We made minor adjustments to the Egg’s program in order to interface an additional sensor, a noise sensor to the platform. However, upon each software update we found that the update wiped our new configuration – requiring an intervention.</blockquote>\n    <p><b>– James Moulding, OpenSensors</b></p>\n    <p>The <i>Breathe Heathrow</i> project experience has raised some important lessons for future sensor projects and rolling out similar smart city projects at scale.</p>\n    <h3>Lessons learnt for sensor projects </h3>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Sensors are sensitive and faults limit data</b></p>\n    <p><i>Breathe Heathrow</i> lost data due to hardware problems, power or device connectivity issues. For sensors to work at their best, devices should be carefully placed, out of the reach of toddlers, and have technical support on-hand to fix the sensors if they break. However, this can be difficult with limited resources.</p>\n    <p><b>Limiting sensors to areas with strong wifi connection can skew results</b></p>\n    <p>Choosing device hosts based on their connectivity can limit the coverage of a sensor project and exclude parts of the community, having negative impacts on the project and results. </p>\n    <p><b>Accurate data depends on a large sensor sample size</b></p>\n    <p>The sensor sample size needs to be large to make sure results are as accurate as possible. For small sample sizes, geographic interpolation plots are very sensitive to changes in readings, particularly observations made in outlying locations; lone sensors some distance from the main observation area potentially skew findings. It is important when designing network coverage that points of significant interest have dense coverage, with a large number of sensors. Increasing the number of sensors makes observations more robust, and means results are much less sensitive to sensor faults, but sensors are not always widely available for community sensor projects.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <h3>Recommendations for building a smart city at scale</h3>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Sensor networks need remote management and a purpose-built wireless network</b></p>\n    <p>Sensor deployments and networks should work in any environment or location and be insulated from their environment. Sensors should be location-agnostic and have their software remotely managed and updated, with wireless connectivity over a purpose-built network such as LoRA and sensors with their own power supply. </p>\n    <p><b>Smart city initiatives need to be informed by a range of open datasets</b></p>\n    <p>Data-driven methodology, bringing together a range of diverse datasets to measure ecosystems of causally related variables – in this case for improved monitoring of a serious public health issue – demonstrates the importance of a clear commitment to open data principles.</p>\n\n    <div>\n      <a href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow-collaboration\" title=\"Next page\"><img class=\"pull-right\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/16/43/56164300f362be08b400000f/summer_showcase_next_but.svg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n      <a href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow-methodology\" title=\"Previous page\"><img class=\"pull-left\" src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/29/f4/5629f4fe1f986a081e000033/previous.svg\" alt=\"\"></a>\n    </div>\n\n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"pull-left col-md-3\">\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow\">About</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow-background\">Background</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow-about-the-data\">About the data</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow-methodology\">Methodology</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box-opacity\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow-lessons-learnt\">Lessons learnt</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow-collaboration\">Collaboration</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"blog-box\">\n    <a class=\"story-link\" href=\"http://theodi.org/summer-showcase-breathe-heathrow-what-next\">What next?</a>\n    </div>\n\n  </div>\n</div>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]}}

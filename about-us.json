The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/198752/13-744-shakespeare-review-of-public-sector-information.pdf\">Shakespeare Review</a> identified £6.8bn of total value in UK public sector data, a report in 2011 estimated that the EU market for public sector data would grow to <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=1093\">€40bn per year</a>, while McKinsey estimated a global market powered by open data from all sectors would create an additional <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/open_data_unlocking_innovation_and_performance_with_liquid_information\">$3tn and $5tn a year</a>. </p>\n<p>The Open Data Institute has identified open data-driven UK companies with a combined <a href=\"http://theodi.org/open-data-means-business\">annual turnover of over £92bn employing over 500,000 people</a>. Transport for London alone has identified a <a href=\"http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2013/12/6550/4\">58:1 return</a> on investment by releasing transport data, in the process helping create global leaders such as Citymapper. Denmark has seen a <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/dirdigeng/getting-open-data-used\">70:1 return on investment</a> by choosing to publish address data openly. In the US, an open data company <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2013/10/02/monsanto-buys-climate-corp-for-930-million/\">has sold for $930m</a> and Landsat data create <a href=\"http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/usgs_top_story/business-experts-see-landsat-as-stunning-return-on-public-investment/\">savings of $350m to $436m per year</a>, while at least <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/many-americans-dont-know-theyre-using-government-data-using-apps-like-uber-pew-reports-says/\">84% of American smartphone owners</a> use an application powered by open data every single day.</p>\n<h3 id=\"background\">Background</h3>\n<p>Founded by Sirs Tim Berners-Lee and Nigel Shadbolt, the ODI is an independent, non-profit, non-partisan, limited by guarantee company.</p>\n<p>The ODI has secured £10m over five years from the UK Government (via the UK innovation agency, <a href=\"http://www.innovateuk.org/\">Innovate UK</a>), and $4.75m from <a href=\"http://www.omidyar.com/\">Omidyar Network</a>, and is working towards long-term sustainability through match funding and direct revenue.</p>\n<p>With global reach, hundreds of members, thousands of people trained, dozens of startups incubated, and a 5,000 sq ft convening space based in the heart of London's thriving Shoreditch area, we invite everyone interested in developing open data to <a href=\"/contact\">get in touch</a>.</p>\n<p>We openly publish our <a href=\"http://dashboards.theodi.org\">performance data</a>. </p>\n<h3 id=\"originalplans\">Original plans</h3>\n<p>The following documents are provided for historical reference.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://e642e8368e3bf8d5526e-464b4b70b4554c1a79566214d402739e.r6.cf3.rackcdn.com/odi-business-plan-may-release.pdf\">Open Data Institute Business Plan 2012-2017</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://e642e8368e3bf8d5526e-464b4b70b4554c1a79566214d402739e.r6.cf3.rackcdn.com/open-data-institute-implementation-plan-2012-and-beyond.pdf\">Open Data Institute Implementation Plan 2012 and beyond</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://e642e8368e3bf8d5526e-464b4b70b4554c1a79566214d402739e.r6.cf3.rackcdn.com/odi-description-and-offer-ask-final.pdf\">Making the UK More Competitive</a> (an early six-page pitch)</li>\n</ul>","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}},"related_external_links":[],"related":[],"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","state":"published","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]}}

Create the business case, learn the structure that can overcome objections, and get your project signed off fast.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatwillitakeaway\">What will I take away?</h3>\n<p>By the end of our workshop you will understand:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to quickly build a compelling business case from simple case studies </li>\n<li>The language that brings home the opportunity of open data to your colleagues</li>\n<li>A five-point pitch structure to stop wasting time and get to the point</li>\n<li>One technique to make sure you leave every meeting on open data with a decision</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"whoisthisfor\">Who is this for?</h3>\n<p>This one is for the open data advocates. You are likely to believe open data has benefits for the organisation but can’t convince your colleagues to share your enthusiasm. You could be at any level and from any background, but are likely to be speaking with people about the subject regularly. You need the drive to advocate for change and the commitment to get things done.</p>\n<h3 id=\"courseprerequisites\">Course prerequisites</h3>\n<p>A basic familiarity with the concept of open data will help.

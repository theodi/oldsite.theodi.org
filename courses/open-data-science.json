More and more businesses are recognising the immense value of being able to derive knowledge and insight from data.</p>\n<p>But 'data science' is an <strong>interdisciplinary field</strong>, combining the knowledge of between three and eight different disciplines in one role. For anyone looking to gain data science skills, it can be incredibly challenging to know where to start.</p>\n<p>This is why at the ODI we created our Open Data Science one-day course. Explore <strong>key data science disciplines</strong>, learn how to access and use the <strong>openly available tools</strong> required to succeed and get <strong>expert advice</strong> from the ODI's Senior Trainer and Data Scientist, Dr David Tarrant. </p>\n<h3 id=\"courseaim\">Course aim</h3>\n<p>To provide you with a solid foundation in open data science and give you the practical skills to apply it to your domain. </p>\n<h3 id=\"whoisthisfor\">Who is this for?</h3>\n<p>Business and technology professionals, journalists, developers, architects, managers, executives, data analysts, performance engineers, project managers, public servants, teaching staff and anyone who wants to explore the world of data science and improve their technical skills. </p>\n<h3 id=\"bytheendofthecourseyouwillbeableto\">By the end of the course you will be able to:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Define open data science</li>\n<li>Describe a number of key data science stories</li>\n<li>Identify the characteristics of open data science projects</li>\n<li>Apply tools to unlock and transform data available on the web</li>\n<li>Perform a number of statistical experiments using R</li>\n<li>Create a simple visualisation for communicating the value of data</li>\n<li>Assess strategies for implementing open data science principles in projects</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"courseprerequisites\">Course prerequisites</h3>\n<p>Participants must be comfortable with manipulating data in spreadsheet applications such as Excel. </p>\n<h3 id=\"courserequirements\">Course requirements</h3>\n<p>A laptop running a copy of Google Chrome, or equivalent modern web browser. The laptop should also not have restrictions on which websites it can access.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"whattoexpect\">What to expect</h3>\n<p>Open Data Science is a fast-paced, information-packed course. Expect to be completely immersed in the world of data science, digging deep into the theory and getting hands-on with various tools. Depending on what you want to do next, we will provide you with relevant materials and resources to take away for further study and continuous improvement. </p>\n<h3 id=\"courselength\">Course length</h3>\n<p>One day</p>\n<h3 id=\"aboutodicourses\">About ODI courses</h3>\n<p>Co-founded by the inventor of the web, Tim Berners-Lee, the ODI offers courses that are friendly, supportive, fun, and take place in our lively headquarters in Shoreditch.

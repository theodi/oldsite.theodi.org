Does a shared infrastructure for finance exist? If so, what is it now, what problems exist with it and how do we design it for the future?</em></p>\n<p>This ODI Futures event – held by the ODI and Thomson Reuters – will explore these questions, highlight new areas of innovation and technology, and ask what the shared language of our financial data infrastructure should be.</p>\n<p><strong>What is data infrastructure for finance?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Data is infrastructure</strong>. It underpins business innovation, transparency, accountability, business innovation and civil society. But we are not giving it the same importance as traditional infrastructure such as our road, rail and energy networks. We need to strengthen the technology, processes, and organisations that make up our data infrastructure.</p>\n<p><strong>Finance is a broad sector</strong>. It includes consumers, banks, digital currencies, payment infrastructure, financial institutions, markets, supply chains and regulators. Across the sector, there’s information and data that everybody needs; there’s data that’s shared between institutions and with markets; and there’s data used only within a single business.</p>\n<p><strong>Topics covered</strong></p>\n<p>During flasktalks, panel discission and Q&amp;A, we will also cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The application of distributed technologies such as blockchains to data infrastructure</li>\n<li>How to design data infrastructure that is as reliable and open as possible</li>\n<li>How to manage personal data with privacy and openness</li>\n<li>How to encourage open innovation</li>\n<li>The connections between finance data infrastructure and that in other sectors</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Speakers and panelists will be announced in due course.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/odi-futures-data-infrastructure-for-finance-tickets-25538683891\">Book now</a> </p>\n<p>Join the discussion on Twitter using #ODIFutures and #DataInfrastructure.</p>\n<p><strong>About ODI Futures</strong></p>\n<p>ODI Futures events bring business, government and academia together to examine the potential for open data in different sectors. They intend to be thought-provoking and offer space for in-depth discussion. ODI Futures events are recorded and we publish slides and sound files for each session.</p>","excerpt":"What is the shared data infrastructure we need to build for an open financial system?

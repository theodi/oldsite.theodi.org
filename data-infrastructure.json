Data infrastructure will only become more vital as our populations grow and our economies and societies become ever more reliant on getting value from data.</p>\n<p>We are not currently treating data as infrastructure. We are not giving it the same importance as our road, railway and energy networks were given in the industrial revolution and are still given now. We risk seeing data only as a tool for transparency when it should also be an engine of efficiency and growth. We need to strengthen our data infrastructure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"activities\">Activities</h3>\n<p>In 2015 <a href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/a-year-in-open-data-how-odi-paved-the-way-for-a-stronger-data-infrastructure-in-2015\" title=\"the ODI paved the way for a stronger data infrastructure\">the ODI paved the way for a stronger data infrastructure</a> and started to define data infrastructure.</p>\n<p>In 2016 we will deepen our understanding of economics and explore how to protect personal data.

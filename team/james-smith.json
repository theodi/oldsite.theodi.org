In 2007 he shifted from traditional software development to the web, and developed an interest in environmental issues at the same time. Since then he has been building sustainability-related projects on the web, starting with behaviour change projects such as <a href=\"http://www.carbondiet.org/\">The Carbon Diet</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dothegreenthing.com/\">Green Thing</a>. He then worked as a lead developer and platform evangelist at <a href=\"http://www.amee.com/\">AMEE</a>, opening up access to greenhouse gas methodologies and data, and along the way creating the world’s first natural language carbon calculator, AskAMEE. He then joined the ODI in January 2013.</p>\n<p>He continues this work as an organiser for <a href=\"http://cleanweb.org.uk/\">Cleanweb UK</a>, a community group with over 1000 members, that inspires and helps developers to build web applications that deal with sustainability issues. Always a fan of achievable goals, in 2015 he stood in the UK general election on a platform based around open source democracy, with open data at its core. He is passionate about using web technology and Open Data to make a better future for everyone, with a particular focus on the environmental and social benefits that can be created.</p>","excerpt":"James leads the ODI’s [Labs programme](http://twitter.com/ODILabs), which aims to push forward the state of the art in open data technology.

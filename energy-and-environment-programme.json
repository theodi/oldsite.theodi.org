The team plans to work with key stakeholders in the energy and social services sectors to define the causes and impacts of fuel poverty and to identify ways in which open data can be used to respond to these. The ultimate goal for the team is to focus on a designated locality/city to create products that help provide better targeting and access of Energy Company Obligation and other funding to help reduce the incidence of fuel poverty and if possible reduce carbon emissions.</p>\n<p>We anticipate running the Energy and Environment Challenge Definition Day in late October 2013 with a view to running the Innovation and Creation Hack Weekend in early December\u0002at which three winning teams will be identified to recieve Â£5k seed-funding and access to mentoring and support through The ODI StartUp Programme.</p>\n<p>The Programme\u0002will span over a nine month period and constitute:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Recruitment of a Programme\u0002Lead -<em>\u0002</strong></em><em>recruitment and\u0002appointment of a domain expert to ensure the successful and relevant delivery of the programme</em></li>\n<li><strong>Challenge definition day</strong>\u0002-\u0002<em>convening data owners, data users and data consumers, thought leaders and industry experts to explore and shape the challenges for the series</em></li>\n<li><strong>Applications open</strong>\u0002-\u0002<em>the formal launch of the competition when applications for participation happen</em></li>\n<li><strong>Development/Acceleration period</strong>\u0002-\u0002<em>an opportunity for teams to form, ideas to consolidate and develop, data to be reviewed, improved and released</em></li>\n<li><strong>Creation and Innovation Weekend</strong>\u0002-\u0002<em>where the products and tools are developed, tested and presented to a panel of judges.

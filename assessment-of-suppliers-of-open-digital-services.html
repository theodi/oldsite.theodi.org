<article class="article-body">
<p>The Open Data Institute is working with the Cabinet Office to improve the procurement of open digital services, including producing guidance for procurement officers and suppliers.</p>
<p>As part of this project, we are putting together a list of suppliers on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/how-to-use-the-digital-services-store#digital-services-framework">Digital Services Framework</a> and indicating which of them can provide digital services that include the publication of open data, to help buyers find them quickly.</p>
<p><strong>This is an opportunity to showcase your open digital services to buyers in the public sector.</strong></p>
<p>You will receive, free of charge, high-quality feedback from ODI about your approach.</p>
<p>We have put together a <a href="#scenario">scenario</a> that involves providing an open digital service. We would like you to tell us how you would provide it. As well as including you on the list of open digital service suppliers, we will assess what you write and publish that assessment.</p>
<p>Specifically, <strong>email a 4-page document by Monday 24th March to <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3b515e55527b4f535e545f521554495c"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="08626d6661487c606d676c6126677a6f">[email&#160;protected]</span></a></strong> proposing how you would provide this service, with the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Understanding data-user needs</strong></p>
<p>How would you go about understanding the needs of different types of data user to develop a solution that meets the needs of specialist and non-specialist users alike?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data processing</strong></p>
<p>How would you take messy data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats and import it into a backend system that can drive a website?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data exploration</strong></p>
<p>How would you create a useful and meaningful interface and/or visualisations so users can pose and answer simple questions from the data?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Legal issues</strong></p>
<p>What activities would you undertake to tackle the legal issues around data publishing, including licensing, intellectual property rights, derived data and privacy?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Practical issues</strong></p>
<p>How would you ensure that the data is easy to find, and that any issues about its quality are documented?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technical issues</strong></p>
<p>How would you publish different types of data (reference data, raw data, aggregate statistical data) as open data in ways that meets a variety of different data users needs? What formats and open standards would you use? How would you approach creating persistent identifiers? What additional metadata, such as provenance metadata, would you provide?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social issues</strong></p>
<p>How would you support users of open data with relevant documentation, source code snippets, example queries and technical advice? How would you provide feedback routes to the publisher?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Team</strong></p>
<p>What team would you put together to provide this service?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When we have assessed the proposals, we will:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Assess your answers based on the criteria set out in the <a href="https://certificates.theodi.org/">ODI Open Data Certificate</a>, as "excellent", "good", "basic" or "poor".</p></li>
<li><p>Annotate your response highlighting aspects we think are particularly strong or weak.</p></li>
<li><p>Publish your response and our assessment in full as open data.</p></li>
<li><p>Notify you that the assessment is published.</p></li>
<li><p>Publish any comments you want to provide on the assessment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Do not include any commercial-in-confidence information in your response as it will be published in full on our website.</strong></p>
<p>If you have any questions please send them to <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4f252a21260f3b272a202b2661203d28"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9df7f8f3f4dde9f5f8f2f9f4b3f2effa">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>
<h2 id="aidscenarioascenario">
<a id="scenario"></a>Scenario</h2>
<p>Human exposure to &#8216;emerging contaminants&#8217; is an increasingly important issue. To understand the risks to human health of chemicals entering the food chain through indirect routes, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) commissioned a scientific study to assess the potential for the contamination of food by chemicals used in pharmaceuticals, veterinary medicines and personal care products. The study was conducted by the Food and Environment Research Agency (FERA) and resulted in the creation of a lot of useful data. As part of a longitudinal study of food contaminants, this study will be repeated on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>DEFRA has an open data strategy which includes making scientific and research information available as open data. The department is now looking for a supplier to help it to publish the data from FERA&#8217;s research as open data. This data has not been published before and the department is looking to meet the needs both of end-users who want to understand the results of the study, and of data-users who want to re-use some or all of the data produced. The information from the study is potentially of wide interest to the public, as well as to journalists and the media, given the wide public interest in food standards.</p>
<p>The aim of the project is to publish the data obtained through the study as open data, in a way that meets the user needs.</p>
<h3 id="userneeds">User Needs</h3>
<p>Three different user needs have been identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Citizens</strong> &#8212; a member of the public who, alerted by a national news story about chemicals in food, wants to understand for themselves what the research says and what it means to them and their family; for example, a parent of a new baby who wants to understand more about chemicals found in particular baby food products. This user may not have the means to process or analyse the underlying data so will rely on a user-friendly visualisations as well as non-technical analyses and explanations of the data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scientific data re-users</strong> &#8212; a specialist who wants to use the raw data from the study, as part of the peer review of the results, or as source data for a comparative analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other data re-users</strong> &#8212; someone who wants to use the product data gathered by the study for an entirely different application, such as supply chain automation, as a source of reference data about foods, or within their own data analyses.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The data produced for the study and that will be published is of three different types:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reference data</strong> &#8212; lists of the foods, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medicines and personal care products tested during the research project.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Raw data</strong> &#8212; data from the study for each and every test on the various products assessed and what chemicals were found, including data about the date and time of the test, the equipment used and the results of the chemical analysis (quantities of each compound found).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Aggregate statistical data</strong> &#8212; based on an analysis of the raw data by the research team, aggregate statistical data from the study giving the level of usage, toxicology, persistence, update and bioaccumulation potential of the different compounds.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="technologiesandlanguages">Technologies and languages</h3>
<p>The data is available in a variety of formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the reference data is available only through semi-structured Word documents.</li>
<li>The raw scientific data is stored in a popular commercial relational database.</li>
<li>The results of the statistical analyses are available in Excel.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the project starts, you will be provided with a snapshot of the data, but will be expected to provide a mechanism for updating the data on a regular basis.</p>
<h2 id="frequentlyaskedquestions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="isthisaprocurementexercise">Is this a procurement exercise?</h3>
<p>This is not a procurement exercise. ODI is not bound by public procurement rules, associated with opportunities advertised in the OJEU.</p>
<p>Our aim is to help public-sector organisations to use the Digital Services framework for delivering their open digital projects by highlighting the capabilities of suppliers on that framework.</p>
<p>Depending on our findings from this exercise ODI would like to promote the use of the Digital Services framework contract, including through our training programme with procurement officers, as a good route for accessing skilled resources to deliver open digital projects.</p>
<h3 id="whoexactlyareyouworkingwithinthecabinetoffice">Who exactly are you working with in the Cabinet Office?</h3>
<p>This assessment is part of the "Open data procurement training" project that was awarded from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/15-million-funding-to-open-up-public-data">Release of Data fund</a>.</p>
<p>The bids for this fund were assessed by the <a href="http://data.gov.uk/odug">Open Data User Group</a> and the fund is managed by the Transparency Team within the Cabinet Office. The Transparency Team is not part of the Government Digital Service. Please email <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d9b3bcb7b099adb1bcb6bdb0f7b6abbe"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3f555a51567f4b575a505b5611504d58">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> if you want to be put in touch with them to double check.</p>
<h3 id="whatisthescopeoftheproject">What is the scope of the project?</h3>
<p>This assessment is a small part of a wider project, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>a guide to open data for public procurement</li>
<li>standard wording for contract clauses for open data</li>
<li>online content about open data and procurement</li>
<li>a programme for a one day training course for procurement officers</li>
<li>120 funded places on the 1 day training course for procurement officers</li>
<li>a survey of suppliers on G-Cloud for the open data service offerings</li>
<li>a survey of suppliers on the Digital Services Framework for the open data capabilities (to aid the construction of long and short lists)</li>
</ul>
<p>Further materials are available <a href="https://github.com/theodi/public-procurement">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h3 id="whyareyoudoingthisnow">Why are you doing this now?</h3>
<p>This project is being run on tight timescales to satisfy the timing constraints on the "Release of Data" fund.</p>
<h3 id="howdoesthisrelatetothedigitalservices2framework">How does this relate to the Digital Services 2 framework?</h3>
<p>There is no official relationship to the development of the Digital Services 2 framework. ODI will work with Cabinet Office with the aim of the work of this project, and the findings from this assessment, feeding into that contract.</p>
<h3 id="howwilltheproposalsbeassessed">How will the proposals be assessed?</h3>
<p>The criteria we will use to assess the proposals are available <a href="https://github.com/theodi/public-procurement/blob/master/dsf-assessment-criteria.md">on Github</a>.</p>
<h3 id="whatifwedontrespond">What if we don't respond?</h3>
<p>You will be listed as a non-respondent. If you wish, you can supply a comment to be provided next to your name.</p>
<h3 id="whatifwerespondlate">What if we respond late?</h3>
<p>We may include your proposal within our assessment, but this will be at our discretion.</p>
<h3 id="willthelistofsuppliersbeupdated">Will the list of suppliers be updated?</h3>
<p>There are no current plans to keep the list of suppliers up to date, but the list will be clearly labelled to indicate when it was created and its scope.</p>

Her work explores relationship between science and the natural world; questioning the use of technology in how we translate nature. </p>\n<p>Her work has been shown at leading institutions including: the Victoria &amp; Albert museum, London’s Institute of Contemporary Art, Kinetica, Barbican Centre, and the Science Museum, as well as internationally in Brazil, Croatia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Russia and the USA, and is held in a number of private collections. Julie has won awards from the Wellcome Trust, the Arts Council, and a Fellowship from Nesta. </p>\n<p>She co-founded a pioneering, artist-led digital-media organisation, Studio Fish (1994-2001), winning numerous awards for innovation. As a board member of MzTEK she is interested in addressing the imbalance of women artists working in the fields of new media, computer arts, and technology.</p>\n<p>Based in London, she is a TED Senior Fellow, and a researcher at the Media &amp; Arts Technology lab at Queen Mary University of London. She is currently combining real-time biological ‘living’ data into an Internet of Living Things. </p>\n<p>At the ODI Summit, Julie will be asking 'is open data open to all?'.

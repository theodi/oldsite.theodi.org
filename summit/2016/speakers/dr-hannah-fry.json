She works alongside a unique mix of physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists, architects and geographers to study the patterns in human behaviour - particularly in an urban setting. Her research applies to a wide range of social problems and questions, from shopping and transport to urban crime, riots and terrorism.</p>\n<p>Alongside her academic position, Hannah is an experienced public speaker giving conference keynotes and taking the joy of maths into theatres and schools. Hannah’s mathematical expertise has led to the development of fascinating documentaries including ‘City in the Sky’ ‘Horizon: How to Find Love Online’ (BBC2), ‘The Joy of Data’ and ‘Calculating Ada: The Countess of Computing’ (BBC4). Hannah regularly appears on radio in the UK, most recently on ‘Computing Britain’, ‘The Curious Cases of Rutherford and Fry’ (BBC R4) and ‘Music By Numbers’ (BBC R1).</p>\n<p>February 2015 saw the publication of Hannah’s book ‘The Mathematics of Love: Patterns, Proofs, and the Search for the Ultimate Equation’ (Simon &amp; Schuster/ Ted) which brings together mathematical equations to provide answers to such questions as: What’s the chance of us finding love? How does online dating work, exactly? When should you settle down?</p>\n<p>Hannah will be hosting the opening session which will include conversations with web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee, AI expert Sir Nigel Shadbolt and Lastminute.com founder Baroness Martha Lane Fox.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/odi-summit-and-awards-2016-tickets-25968974903\">Book now</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theodi.org/summit/2016\"><< Back to ODI Summit 2016 main page</a></p>","excerpt":"Dr Hannah Fry is a lecturer in the Mathematics of Cities at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis at UCL.

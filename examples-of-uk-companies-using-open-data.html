<h3>How are UK companies working with open data?</h3>
<p>In this section we highlight 12 companies that use or produce open data as part of their work in different ways. From <b>smart city planning to flood warnings, job opportunities to education options</b>, the companies use open data to offer diverse services to businesses, government and individuals.</p>
<hr>
<p><a id="arup"></a></p>
<h3>Arup</h3>
<p><em>Arup uses open data to help plan smart cities and mitigate against risk and natural disasters in the built environment.</em></p>
<p>Arup is a multinational professional services firm of designers, planners, engineers, consultants and technical specialists. It provides engineering, design, planning, project management and consulting services for the built environment.</p>
<p>Open data is an important part of Arup&#8217;s work with smart cities and the technology that supports them. Arup has developed policy frameworks that focus on the role of open data to <b>deliver new, better or more efficient services in cities</b>, while responding to decreasing public sector budgets. Arup incorporates open data as part of the technical architecture required to overcome constraints in cities such as traffic and congestion, and improve engagement between citizens and city leadership. The company has developed a<b> risk information action system</b>, The Hazard Owl, which uses real-time natural hazard information from public data feeds. It is used to alert clients of natural disasters so they can mitigate against risk and help to protect their business.</p>
<p>Arup also sees open data as an increasingly meaningful source of information for the analytics and advisory services it provides.</p>

<h3>Adzuna</h3>
<p><em>Adzuna simplifies the job hunting process by helping users better understand the market and find the best jobs for them.</em></p>
<p>Adzuna is a search engine that aggregates job adverts to provide a comprehensive view of the jobs market. It combines adverts from several hundred different online sources, including the largest online job boards and vacancies advertised directly by employers. This <b>gives job hunters access to over 1 million job adverts</b> at a given time.</p>
<p>Adzuna uses open data to develop its Job Index, which provides an accurate, complete and timely view of the UK jobs market. The Job Index compares Labour Market Statistics (Jobseeker&#8217;s Allowance Claimant Count), published by the Office for National Statistics, with Adzuna&#8217;s jobs data to generate new metrics such as jobseekers per vacancy by location. These are reported in its monthly Job Market Report, which can be used by job hunters to <b>compare the availability of jobs in different areas of the country</b>.</p>
<p>The company also provides free access to its jobs data via an application program interface (API). The aim is to allow third-parties to reuse the data aggregated by Adzuna to power job-search services in their websites and develop new applications.</p>

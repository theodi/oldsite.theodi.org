In each case, however, the business has <b>taken an open approach as a strategic response to challenges</b> that they face.</p>\n\n    <p>As part of their approach, <a href=\"http://theodi.org/open-for-big-business-case-study-thomson-reuters\" title=\"Case study: Thomson Reuters\"><b>Thomson Reuters</b></a>, <a href=\"http://theodi.org/open-for-big-business-case-study-arup\" title=\"Case study: Arup\"><b>Arup</b></a> and <a href=\"http://theodi.org/open-for-big-business-case-study-syngenta\" title=\"Case study: Syngenta\"><b>Syngenta</b></a> have begun to:</p>\n\n    <ul class=\"small\">\n      <li><b>understand their internal use of data</b>, how it should be managed and developed</li>\n      <li><b>articulate business cases</b> for improving internal data capability and increasing open data publication</li>\n      <li><b>improve the quality of data </b>they hold</li>\n      <li><b>build trust and collaboration </b>in the market</li>\n      <li><b>enable deeper engagement</b> with customers, collaborators and future partners, through feedback on data being published and its uses </li>\n      <li><b>create partnerships with new startups</b> and market entrants with an open ethos</li>\n      <li><b>build an organisational culture that is open</b> to feedback and insight inside the organisation, as well as outside in the environment it operates in</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>Addressing the challenges that big businesses face, and taking advantage of the opportunities that the data revolution brings, requires new ways of thinking and operating as a business. This is not only a technical challenge but also an organisational and cultural challenge. Big businesses that respond to these challenges are creating new business models and ways of working that give them a competitive advantage, whatever the future brings.</p>\n    <hr class=\"hr-black\">\n    <h4>About this paper</h4>\n    <p>This paper was written and produced by the Open Data Institute in 2016, based on interviews with the teams at Thomson Reuters, Arup and Syngenta.
